We have class that has: 

√WxH - array of 0,1,2

√It represents a spiral starting at point x, y moving in spiraling way N steps. 
Now present at x1, y1. 

√We need function that knows to move back and forwards. 

Also each i on the spiral has flag if this is first or second try. 
If the try fails - we move back our state to 2 and move x1, y1 one step back 

- when cell is added we use spiral to track everything new it opens until R=2. 
- check there is no contradiction 
- check if something unknown can be known 
- if yes apply value and metavalue so that it could be removed later on 
- go on spiral and open evreything which there is to open including finding contradictions. 

- We need Add and Remove operation to spiral layer. 

Multi spiral class - our creature. 
- Has several spirals. 
- actions: it can evolve each spiral for 1 generation / open new spiral. 
- Has a score of stability. 
-- We prioratize spirals such that the CGOL state of them is preferably stable. And more weight in the center. 
-- The inner radius should only be stable - the outer radius should also be stable and state 0. This should be a slope weight 

Input from golly*.
- Have a script that runs inside golly and generates input
