Math without induction

- Limit of information in physics. 
- Factor of resolution 
-- Paradox of: lets take the first number people will not be able to describe with any sentence in the next 100 years. How did I took it? the answer is: factor of resolution. 
-- Lets hold earth in our hands. I can't see myself with perfect resolution as I'm not perfect. 
- Similiar agents and predicting the future. Rational behaviour of limited agents, and irrational axiomatic agents. Vadim Kosoi. 
-- The sentence can be proven for any similiar resources agent group. 
-- Relativistic theory of mind. A dog vs. human as sub space which can't be seen by the dog. We will use usual arithmetics to show that factor of resolution of the dog will force the dog to build N dimentional model for low dimentions. Such that we will get matryoshka the same way we're getting matryoshka brain and it's limits. i.e. imagine we have dynamic speed of light, and faster ceatures can overcome the boundries while others can't.
