This is a dojo just like in martial arts, but with strict rules and scoring system. 

Two modes - fight and analysis. Just like in chess. 

Fight has rules. Analysis can be done with a whole group. And a person can explain what he learned from the experience by fighting a group. The group is also a collective mind can respond in very simple democratic or other ways, and can strive to coherence. If a group is not coherent you find a person who is not coherent. Try to see where the graph has been broken and how this happened inside group dynamics that it’s not consistent although each person is. The simplest case is a triangle. How do you solve the conflict between three people? You need to synchronize them for the group. They need to realize their personality is fucking up the system locally and the system should work on this problem by practicing tree growth. All this is solvable although it might be hard to solve and some problems might arise from democracy. 

If the group is well synchronized it can also send a representative it trusts, or someone random from the group. And this is internal politics of the group. 

Fight between two congruent systems has some very strict rules. They are the mother and father of good thinking habits humanity has learned from decades of experience. Here we collect them into a knowledge.



Philosophical faults. 
Irrelevance fault. Conspiracy theory, solipsis and dream argument that deny scientific knowledge. 
Logical traps - theories that you can’t exit from after accepting them without heavy price. 
Psychological biases. 
Empirical question flag. 
Avatar question flag. 
Freedom of avatar. You can represent anyone you like.
Violence against avatar. Don’t let people to dictate yourself. You chose who you are what you think what you know and what you prefer. 

Enforcing policy which is not mandatory and irrational (like forcing correct english which has no reason it’s just random point in time that got canonized). Letting language and its syntax evolve naturally and improve evolutionary with other syntax. 
Infinite loop: asking why, why, why - and proving points by this ed nauseam

Arguments and language problems which when translated into science make no sense. For example criticizing the other without showing alternative is better. 

Bringing the option as fact while it's an intuition. Every statement should be assumed with probability, and no single truth only up to some error. 

One should argue up until they fall into faulty. When you fall into logical contradiction, you out. We can allow logical contradictions just for fun to see what happens. But usually the default in dojo is those rules. 

If we should have audience to make like dislike 

Making small conspiracies. For example trolling and answering random questions about everything, to someone in the dojo, and he should notice that. Or having only 10 words to pass information to him. 

For example someone represents Lenin. We ask him first, how can we argue with him? What source can we ask him to make sure he represents Lenin correctly. For example can we quote Lenin to him and ask him to clarify? Or to Lenin's friends quotes about lenin? Or can we bring all scientific quotes of people? So one can say - I can only explain myself as lenin. Or I can explain myself and why my friends thought of me this way. Or I can say I need to explain where everyone went wrong in understanding me as lenin. This can be done as a group as well. We can ask Lenin and we can propose election, and we can write sentences and vote on them to represent lenin best way as a group. And each individual can go to a stage and talk to group representation of Lenin which he can’t do alone. 

All this up until a faulty. When the faulty is happening we should practice synchronization of the group about lenin. If it didn’t help we try to debug, understand how did this cycle happens assuming no trolling. We can ask an individual or take a bug remove people until the bug is happening and think together how to make it consistent again. Someone should change his views about Lenin, so people should argue among themselves and someone probably wrong and this could be proven, that someone went wrong at some point. Working on Lenin reconstruction in our mind. 

Simulation rating. Person is talking about himself and asks questions. We score the question by percentile. And add them. Or the questions can have rating like in chess. 
 Argument raing 
Backtracking rating 
Group debug and synchronization skill rating. 

Techniques: 

Group technique. Talk about what is common and not common between you two. For starters why have you came here? Find your common factors and feel the other in your simulation. 

Now connect. Talk not only about yourself but other people you have met here before or heard about them before.

Like filosophy but with ed hominem. And we develop special syntax which can be proved and we will specially prove it mathematically to increase the signal between groups. Like no avatar violance, and freedom to define avatar. You can play with many polytops as you like, and you need to prefix the polytop without assuming the language is default. You can introduce new words, and people in the dojo will open their mind to other simple things, expanding their words and their understanding of possible realities. Because it's limited in our lifetime. 

- Syntax trick 1. I have my words you have your words and we try to understand the difference and invent new words to explainand express the meaning better. 

- For example it's usually not expected from the reader to take certain position but it's possible. Please stand up now. And churches do it. And this adds syntax meaning to language. It's enforced, but it's also adds some body language which is another communication divice to the reader. So we can say Do this action, DTA and expect the writer and the reader to synchronize on the ropic. And if the reader is not in sync, it's like he is simply considered not readed at all. Like it's a mistake readin this sentence this way.

- It's also not always black and white and this is why we can add |x|(probability). For example |not everything is black and white|(0.9). This means my certainty 0.9. 

- You can also write |envernomn|Statement| and |Alice|My name is allice| or |simsim314|Ma name is misha|. And this will mean that I have opened a simulation, where I can say -my name is misha, and this simulation, this virtual window name is simsim314. 

- Tree split - uncertainty [statment1, statement2]. Tree split continiuous (statement1, statement2)

- comment to return to. like in math (4)

- Tracking back syntax. |(4)|Avatar B|statement|. Go back in tree to (4) and think what would B say. This is the conclusion.  

The rule is at the moment you switch Avatar you say. And you can close virtual window. So Alice.open. Statements about alice, Alice.close. And we assume each conscsioness is running it's own virtual env. So the default is physical reality. Unless someone wants to change its default. 

I mean treating our conscsiousness as it was a virtual reality, and we play in it very well. And optimize to pass information in debates. 

Reinterpret math without induction.
