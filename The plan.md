Several Ideas which move in parallel (currently 5). 

0. Coherence therapy. It's a therapy that helps people to make some meditations, meta thinking, good thinking habbits, and use their thinking in order to solve their own problems, or understand their own place in the universe and stuff. People might be somewhat confused or not sure about their thinking habbits, and I can help, to make their thining patterns clearer and withuout noise. Using science and a therapy I invented. I don't use it on "patients" only people who are willing to talk and pay me money for that. 

1. Dojo. A place where people learn to build valid arguments, define themselves and their opinions, make a real filosophical disccussion with ed homined, and without violance against avatars. Dojos will have some measruments and competitions between them. 

Dojo can become a ground to debate. Debate can be translated and popularized. We will make an "anti" movement to something which is very stupid, we will make videos with answers to the most stupid claims, and we will turn into the streets and will demand to stop the madness about radical vegiterianism, the same way they are there to agitate for them. Making it social movement of reason and real debate, and will invite vegeterians for the debate and show them wrong, and this is the debate dojo. 

2. Startup. Using scientific knowledge that already exist and we will improve together with the academy hopefully. (Need to think more) 
- Help the field of self drigin cars on real roads today. Need math model of human behaviours and understanding of people. 
- Office management, and office self management as a group. 
- Parenthood, learn to communicate and understand your child. 
- Sim city for metropolitens. 

2.5 Teleshow about making the first hive mind. 

- In production we need 1K volonteers for 10 days camp. 
- Each volounteer is asigned to a group. There are 10 groups. Those groups are seperated. 
- They learn to understand other people and listen to them. They learn to make questionaiers about themselves that divide the group into two parts. Basically people from the same group are burned for the experiment's statistics. 

- Now we shuffle people. Create 10 new groups and now starting to pass information about each other. 
- Now this means we need to make everyone in the new shuffle new to each other. 30 groups of 30 people. 30 people is 6 x 6 we still should see the signal due to 30 groups. 100x100 to simulate 10x10. And see the information about people is flowwing and has a rate. This is not trivial that we are also an information flowing in other's people head and the resolution can be measured, and function of a distance. 

- Show people how to make experiments. Explaining the science behind it. 
- We will consult scientists, on how to represent graphs of knowledge about people, and detect the geniouses of simulation other people. 

- Then we will show intuitions of people about people. 
- Then we will show the aduiance they are also a hive mind, and we will use an app to call and make a suggestion about something. 
- We will locate the best people doing this. Invite them to the show, and make it much more clear signal of hive mind and collective group consiosness in live. 

- Then we will ask people to define their group, and we will ask them to act as a group of people. This will also be in live. 
- Then we will make conversations with this group as like it was a real living being very similiar to a "real" collective mind which makes sense. People will be able to chat with him. 

- This will be on flix.

3. Hives. An app that implements the knowledge of group comunication and creates virtual dojos. 

- Everything hivable in hives 
- People start to think about themselves as file in folder of humanity, and start to explore humanity itself by the methods of you, me, you and me, and group. 5 minutes a week you speak to random person from the world, and see the hive emerging. This is basically a meditatoin on seeing the hive of humanity all the time. 
- Small app that can be written is voting mechanism such that you can speak fast to a group.
- Maybe write a book as book is 1 month, and then we will go from there. 
- Self definition as avatar. You can represent any idea. 
- Group coherence. People talk to each other from the group to define the limit between themselves and the group and help the group to define itself through primitive tools of opinion polls, elections, representatives of the group. 
- The information flow is from bottom up, people learn about the group, speak to random people from that group, and generally care about the group they are part off. The information flows up, upvoted by the group to self define it better, and solve it's problems better. It's all dynamically "hivy" configurable. 

4. Consciosness olympiad. This is where all the dojos compete. Intuitice branch of understanding conscsioness. In the olympiad there are 6 sub branches. 

- Boardgame of questions about people (matvey). Dividing people into groups. 

- Part 1. Single person understanding. This is done by people telling a story about themselves and different people try to answer their questions. People who ask better and more preciselly increase in elo rating. 

- Part 2. Communication understanding. Someone says A the other B. And they argue, or tell a story about themselves. 

  - Each person tells a story about himslef. (Part 1 x 2).
  - People are voting and asking questions about the interaction between them on the stage. What to ask them, what they will answer. Beting elo points on this. And some will win and some will lose. 

- Part 3. Small group of people. 

  - Get points for finding decoherence. 
  - Get exra points to debug it and solve it. 

- Part 4. Two coherent groups can converse and come into interaction and this is really fun to see. This is the major application. 

5. Science of conscioussness. This is a field that should define itself, know what to ask and who, to help the information flow from one branch of the field to another, and help the field as a whole. The time between new math model, and new group coherence solution should be minimized. 

-1. Mathematical models of person in vacuum (single point in time). Generalized psychology, and other approaches (partially solved). 

  - Internal coherence measure. 

-2. Mathematical models of person when appliyed external force 

  - Situational decision making models generalized. 
  - Peer pressure (social psychology). 

-3. Models of peer to peer. 

  - Peer to peer in vacuum. 

    - Predict the interaction between them. Analyze and solve (exist in psychology of communication). 

      - Create language and syntax and good practices to make the communication optimized for passing messages from one to another. Move it up to the language practices in Dojos. 

  - Peer to peer in conflicting situations. 
    - Predict what will happen (should exist in literature) 
      - Lears to solve it with minimal suffering to each of them. (Conflict resolution is science). 

-4. Groups. Define, explore, measure things about them. (sociology)
  - Measure group coherence. 
  -- One should ask memebers of the group what they think about X 
  -- One should ask as well what would people answer: what everyone think about X. How are we divided.
  --- We could ask first what do you think majority thinks, and what percintile. 
  -- Strugle to minimize the difference 
  
  - Check if the group has well defined self definition. 
  - Help the group to become more coherent. 
  - Debug decoherence and develop tools. (graph theory + sociology)
  - Make politics protocols. (filosphy of politics)
  - Different economical models of coherent groups. (Economy + sociology)

-5. Group to Group communication. 
  - Finding protocols of communication that worked and helped pass messages. 

-6. Group to Group conflict resolution. 
  - History of conflict resolutions (History + some science of this thing).
