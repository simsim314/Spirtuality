Several Ideas which move in parallel (currently 5). 

1. Dojo. A place where people learn to build valid arguments, define themselves and their opinions, make a real filosophical disccussion with ed homined, and without violance against avatars. Dojos will have some measruments and competitions between them. 

(-1, 1.3.19.Simkin)
2. Startup. Using scientific knowledge that already exist and we will improve together with the academy hopefully. (Need to think more) 
- Help the field of self drigin cars on real roads today. Need math model of human behaviours and understanding of people. 
- Office management, and office self management as a group. 
- Parenthood, learn to communicate and understand your child. 
- Sim city for metropolitens.

3. Hives. An app that implements the knowledge of group comunication and creates virtual dojos. 
- Self definition as avatar. You can represent any idea. 
- Group coherence. People talk to each other from the group to define the limit between themselves and the group and help the group to define itself through primitive tools of opinion polls, elections, representatives of the group. 
- The information flow is from bottom up, people learn about the group, speak to random people from that group, and generally care about the group they are part off. The information flows up, upvoted by the group to self define it better, and solve it's problems better. It's all dynamically "hivy" configurable. 

4. Consciosness olympiad. This is where all the dojos compete. Intuitice branch of understanding conscsioness. In the olympiad there are 6 sub branches. 

- Boardgame of questions about people (matvey). Dividing people into groups. 

- Part 1. Single person understanding. This is done by people telling a story about themselves and different people try to answer their questions. People who ask better and more preciselly increase in elo rating. 

- Part 2. Communication understanding. Someone says A the other B. And they argue, or tell a story about themselves. 

  - Each person tells a story about himslef. (Part 1 x 2).
  - People are voting and asking questions about the interaction between them on the stage. What to ask them, what they will answer. Beting elo points on this. And some will win and some will lose. 

- Part 3. Small group of people. 

  - Get points for finding decoherence. 
  - Get exra points to debug it and solve it. 

- Part 4. Two coherent groups can converse and come into interaction and this is really fun to see. This is the major application. 

5. Science of conscioussness. This is a field that should define itself, know what to ask and who, to help the information flow from one branch of the field to another, and help the field as a whole. The time between new math model, and new group coherence solution should be minimized. 

-1. Mathematical models of person in vacuum (single point in time). Generalized psychology, and other approaches (partially solved). 

  - Internal coherence measure. 

-2. Mathematical models of person when appliyed external force 

  - Situational decision making models generalized. 
  - Peer pressure (social psychology). 

-3. Models of peer to peer. 

  - Peer to peer in vacuum. 

    - Predict the interaction between them. Analyze and solve (exist in psychology of communication). 

      - Create language and syntax and good practices to make the communication optimized for passing messages from one to another. Move it up to the language practices in Dojos. 

  - Peer to peer in conflicting situations. 
    - Predict what will happen (should exist in literature) 
      - Lears to solve it with minimal suffering to each of them. (Conflict resolution is science). 

-4. Groups. Define, explore, measure things about them. (sociology)
  - Measure group coherence. 
  - Check if the group has well defined self definition. 
  - Help the group to become more coherent. 
  - Debug decoherence and develop tools. (graph theory + sociology)
  - Make politics protocols. (filosphy of politics)
  - Different economical models of coherent groups. (Economy + sociology)

-5. Group to Group communication. 
  - Finding protocols of communication that worked and helped pass messages. 

-6. Group to Group conflict resolution. 
  - History of conflict resolutions (History + some science of this thing).
