OO Programming is well suited to hierarchical representation of reality. For example we have a tree like an organization. With bosses and bosses bosses etc. So basically our classes are capable only to represent feodalism in the best way/ This is why Zukerberg has made the facebook in the image of feodalism as this is the best to make delegation into computer language (in groups). 

We need a new language that is working as follows (think about democracy vs. feodalism). This is the same it's should be done with people. 

-The regular hierarchy - Tree
-Sync between two same level classes. They need to update their private and public memebers to be more insyn with one another, because there is an information in other instances that can be learned. 
- sync group. This group of the same level can sync it's knowledge and information upwards. 
- Group coherence. How disperce is the data in the group. Is it a small cluster or very various types. Should be clear. 
- Sync groups between different hierarchies. And this is when the group has reached coherence, we should make sync between groups pollicy. 


A normal IDE is neeeded. 

Say we have a flow of data running in real time. We want to fix something inside the flow. We 
1. Record all the time the input and the outputs cases in our data. We just collect a lot of cases flowing through this part of code. 
2. Now we recode it and make sure the data everywhere else is flowing the same way. We kinda push up a layer and work then we check with tests all the common cases are working fine. The we check with other code developers the code is ok. If not we get rejects and fix them, and commit the new code. 
3. We need a visualization of code and data flow. And we need to work in visual env. to adapt our systems. Using our hands to move everything like in regular life. Like mechanics.
