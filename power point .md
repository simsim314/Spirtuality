We as humanity solve all the time problems that are already solved. And this is because we are missing 5 scientific research areas, which actually exist but don't communicate and they should communicate like close realtives in a small family. 

Science #0 Good philosofy 

- No faults from any research area use all human knowledge
- Know who to ask for the question in hand
- Debate about things using avatars 
- Merge all human knowledge into a single big picture and make debates which are done in a correct scientific and adult way, where you explore people and their assumptions, and try to show them what their philosofy is. Don't debate science, and don't reproduce old arguments. 
- Don't stuck in a loop, and maximize productivity throught debate to pass information in best way. 

Science #1 Concsiousness in a vacuum simulation. 

Intuitive simulators (best in the human knowledge field)
People who know to answer questions of the sort: how does it feels in that and that scenario. And people that went throught it will make questioniars. 

Mathematical models. 
Mathematitians, psychologists, physicists (we can use asbtarct informational models), computer scientists, neurologists, economists - should create a good approaximation of human concsiousness to predict its behaviour. Compete with concsiousness ginuises. 

Predict people from the past - or imaginary. Writers and actors are best for this. 

Science #2 Concsiousness interaction simulation. 

Predict how two concsiousnesses will interact. Intuitive + Mathematical
Find and fix bad communication protocols  
Predict the best course of action to resolve conflict. (conflict solving is a scientific field)

Science #3 Group Coherence 

- The self as a big group that needs to be synchronized (psychology)
- The group of coherent personalities, need another level of group coherence (sociology)
-- Practices that increase coherence (talk about the group and people in it with random people - 5 minutes each for an hour)
-- Debug group decoherence, find bugs and solve them as in conflict resolutions. 
-- Use graph theory to represent the group and solve the problems (mathematitians + sociologists)
- Developing some voting system which represents the group and fine tune it to the group intuitions 

Science #4 Group communication and conflict resolution 

- As with individuals coherent groups are capable to converse.
- They need also a strategy to resolve conflicts as groups. This is similiar to single person conflict resolution. 

Applications: 

Academy: 
Good philosofical backgrounds, that need to be collected into a big data repository and people who learn a lot about everything. This is a must for any society. Meta knowledge, and people who know everything and know who to ask. This should be academic field. 

Labratory of concsiousness. Another academic field, like math. People which are good in understanding other people, will make it scientific, and spread their knowledge like in chess.

People intuitive consiosness simulators best of humanity effort to understand itself before the machines. Like they should have it in greece

Sim city and simulating the future city project 
Communities app where people from all over the world are communicating and having a good signal to noise ratio 

World watch - make sure everyone in the world in real time are happy. In scale of thousand of people. 
City sim city, and local communications.
