Apps:

Think global, think humanity. An app that tries to track different people, their problems and issues, their location on scale of cities. Also records history, and need to think how do we store this info, and help people share their state of consiousness. i.e. what current problem are they solving or what they currently going in their lives. How they live their day to day routine, how are they satisfied with themselves. We try to create global humanity map, and use it to communicate. i.e. each person can pay some virtual money to speak to any other person. Allow society to society communication. Ask most popular question of some society and answer as a society. We can ask kids in israel. We can ask adults in japan. We can ask by gender, by social status etc, by country. Q&A communities. If something very bad happens to some community they can pay money and signal the other communties in the world they are in trouble/dnager, and effort can be done to pressure their local goverments or/and replace them by better ones. Thinking of ourselves as global community. 

open facebook. Make it democratic, add city, make it sim city. Game and social. Make it open structure that people decide how they manage themselves not zukerberg authocracy coming from feodalism. 


short stories 

##High quality short stories: 
- feeling the others. We now know where everyone else are more or less, we have cellphones. Very soon the grasp of the I wil change, and I will be the collective? and just my ability to simulate anyone else at somedistance of me. 
- moving galaxies to prevent collision with andromeda project
- exponent of robots in space - trying to reach highest exponent in stead of killing or war 
- star wars with robots which don't feel just want to force and replicate 
- the now witnessing. idea that we can live only now and oserve best the now and only now 
With the hat and cube made of mirrors and my white 
- 100 million years from now. People get emerged into simulations, enjoy life. 
- radnom society or free will project. Where they chose to genetically modify themselves to make themselves non deterministic people. So they make some random choices at some random points in life the same as it would be placed in society where this is a value. 

- the future is the same as we are but living much slower and reliving every moment of us and every moment in humanity much more times. 

- numbers story. So the gut is learning about his own numbers. They explain how it's all working today and what is the project and what they did before so that you will understand your number. You can always deviate, do something else at some level. This is internal number issues so to speak. Because as we understand that we have responsibility for the next guy in line in the next second the same responsibility is for the next guy with this number. And you know the number is infinite as much as the the consmic body is infinite - and the evacuation could be done only into space shuttles. You also part of this community and this is another cycle of the same story and you can see everything about all the previous cycles. Everything you do was already done before by someone. Every situation every scenario every meaning of words was already in some way said before. Unless you have found a new path then it's VERY cool on galctic scale. 

- cities and quotas of human numbers 
- Ð¡ube copy machine - brain in happiness living single moment in infinite loop/
- space shuttles will not fight because for the operators there is no point in fighting. The community which creates soldiers. And this is the question: where is all the consiousness located? On what time scale? 

- little by little the humans that will survive will be the very few that were still believing in having many kids. As this is obvious that having more kids is evolutionary and the ideas that bring to lowering the population will not prevail over time vs. ideas that will not. because this is obvious that over time the majority will still believe everyone have to have 8 kids, we need either eradicate this belief from the root to make it criminalized like in china, to enforce it very very stronly, or the groups that believe in maximal amount of kids will take over the world. And they will be very they will very suffer and they will be counted in trilions. At least if we still want to have democracy. In israel this is already happening, traditional jews are already 25 percent and they still have 6 kids in the family. We need to stop being democratic, before this is too late it will become like hitler, so we need the same solution like in Egypt and Jordan. We have either to use our force now to stop it from growing and exploding or we will sufer the consecquences of doing nothing and letting this desies of over population take over our reality.

-- Or we can identify ourselves with the community completelly, and then - we simply live much slower. 


##Philosofical issues:

- compiler from idea to reality. 
- infinite universe optimization. 
- What is suffering? Rick and morty legs possion. How does it happens? The right to die and not suffering. Our culture is sadistic. 
- On death. Phiosofical issue. 
- Sado mazo as source of all human and cultural relationships. 
-- being slave (slavery with extra steps)
-- seeing the queen. Forgetting the reason but keeping the tradition. 
- living ourselves through the eyes of others. 
- What is Philosofy? 
- Consiousness is not in the brain - is nowhere. The brain is part of the consiousness simulation. Place is part of consiousness simulation. We just place ourselves begind the eyes. 
- Humanity as a tree or as an ant colony. As organized exploration mechanism. 
- Memory and illusion. Rewriting the past. 
- The concept of sin as manipulation of human psyche as a hack. 
- Kety perry egypt? how they use historical archytypes to relate to our collective memory. Laught. 
- Nature of humanity. Coloseum in anctient rome and greece. Being pussy and compationate is bad for romans. 
- Anti propoganda, instead of making commercials they make propoganda. 
- Going to the unkown, making the full circle of family behaviour. 
- Thoughts about war and why it will not happen (the p is decreasing every year). 
- Matrix perspective on Jesus. How improbable to behave like Jesus when you have full control over reality.
- Institutions are maladaptive. 
- Jesus as messiah. Other second commings. 
- Religion is simply a technology. 
- Christianity as nihilistic teaching 
- Pilpul about camera with titelman 
- The first meating with white people. 
- the need to zoom out
- Enough food to everyone stop fighting, exponent disaster
- The army devolution 
- The only mistake people make: reality is adude. A dude which is forcing you. Imagination is escape of this dude. But before escaping we should understand him very very well. We just need to stop make our master in our image and make him better or nicer than he truly is/
- I can't understand myself - but I can understand myself under the limitation of being in very short time interval where shorter time intervals have no meaning and at the moment the time came into being - I can basically grow exponentially in theory this is possible to maintain for a while, this growth. And this is what drugs do - if we live in a reality where drugs 
- Living in very large scale CA. I don't understand that well the design, of 10-35 of the automaton but if so this is possible. Maybe we can reduce physics to CA
- Morality is only a prat social psychology. Like single individual. 
- The ideas from the app about social structures. 

Mathematical ideas: 

- The idea that symbolism is meaning. Look when you take 010001101 you know nothing. Only when you wrap it into classes then it start to make sense. You need a compiler a meaning which is more than 0-1 something which knows to read the 01 and make it do work. Something like GOL rule. 
- the recursive defenition of operation. +, * ^ etc so we can write 17, 17, 17 - and mean the 17th order operation between the two. 
- Chess games of N people vs N people white vs black, each side moves his pieces, each person is responsible of k pieces on the board and only he can move his pieces. 
- Recursive definition of 17, 17,..., 17 as follows: 17 is a number. You search google for 17 you get the 17 th result. This will be called 17, 17. Now you can do it for any symbol. For example 16 times 17. when you search google for this symbol the 17th result. Yet it's still not recursive. 

- Factor of resolution. In  the moment you don't see everything. The factor of resolution is limitation to understand other beings completelly. We see evrything with limited resolution and we miss something all the time. This consiosness limitation even for array of matryoshka brains it holds. 
- This brings me to consiousness distance. 
- Chip geometry like see also chip of the 21st century 
- We can assume too low factor resolution to be = zero. I mean there is theory of relativity. For example lets take a number which can't be described in less than milion words. Here I present to you it described with less than million words. This means that this sentence is not valid. But why? My answer is factor of resolution. When you speak about million words number - you make a fault, you don't really think of million words number, you think of three words number. One of those words is million, but the self reference usage of this number to the sentence create what I call factor of resolution paradox. You can't refer to the self with factor of resolution lower than the self itself. Now imagine I hold a globe - with myself in it. Is this invalid sentence? Not necceserily as long as I understand my simulaton of the globe is much lower than the simulation of myself. This is actually physically possible to create a globe with simulated people on it. One just hould notice the factor of resolution of such simulation. 


- A santense that I want to bring to mathematical level speaking of consiosuness as universal turing simulator. i.e. the ability to simulate in finite time any other turing simulator. And because our brain is turing computer, or maximum quantum computer yet still it's finite computer because information is limited per quibic centiminter, this shows that one of several truth is correct: 

- Either there is unlimited amount of information inside my body. Inside the sphere which contains my body. This contradicts physics. 
- Or we can say the information is limited and the the many world interpretation will have to be finite. 
- how many world interpretation could be finite? We know particles are in superposition? So the superposition is finite as well. There is a limit somewhere we don't know how to see, but it's there and beyond that we're not sure how to provide non mathematical explanation that answers only partial questions about planks distance. like there is no meaning to talk bellow plank distance but above it yes for every distance. Why is it so it's hard to explain. But there is this limit. So many world interpretation to be finite will mean that the computer we're currently running on, is simulating us with limited percision. How does it possible to hold both? we start to unite back behind the curtains to preserve information and yet to make it like there is only one universe. So when I throw cubes and do different things the information from both places is flowing. Otherwise if I'll not start to converge the universe will waste all its computenational power to simulate only me because I threw so many cube.
