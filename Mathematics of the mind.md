## Mathematics of the mind

Our brain has the capacity to feel, understand and predict possible futures and states of other people around us. This means that our brain has natural capacity to simulate other people, and understand what happens in their mind. We do it not only by building complex models but also by placing ourselves in their place. This means that we try to learn from single example - which is our consciousness, about the others and we’re doing it quite well. Obviously some people understand others better, and some worse, but we all doing it to some extent. The ability to place ourselves in different possible realities, and answer to the question “how does it feels” - is the basic quality of using consciousness. 

__Definition:__ Intuitive theory of mind (ITOM) is the capacity to answer the question “how does it feels”, for many different scenarios. 

__Definition:__ ITOM score, is the average quality of the answer over all questions of the sort “how does it feels”. We obviously can’t measure it exactly but only approximately. 

__Definition:__ Mind exploration is the practice that improves ITOM score by various means. 

To be more practical, we can say that many people can write questions that based on a story of their lives, ask people to answer different question about them (making it american exam). Some people will on average score higher than others, those people have obviously better ITOM score. The claim in this book, is that it’s possible to work on this score, that the score is important, and that there is a language and exercises that help to think and simulate other people (including ourselves). 

Obviously ITOM is working by some algorithm. This means that we can ask the question: how to formulate it mathematically? Having a mathematical language that describes phenomenons is very important. 

Definition: Mathematical theory of mind (MTOM), is a theory which translates ITOM to mathematical language. 

Although there is no claim for complete MTOM, there is an attempt to formulate a mathematical language and to show the way to think about ITOM in mathematical terms. 

__Definition:__ Consciousness center is treating our mind as a point in the center of the universe. 

__Definition:__ Consciousness distance is the subjective feeling of distance between ourselves, and some other “entity”. 

__Definition:__ Consciousness explosion is an entity that enters the physical reality and influences many consciousnesses i.e. event, person or idea that becomes popular and “resonates” with many people. 

__Definition:__ Consciousness speed is the speed by which our brain is capable to introduce new information into our mind. 

## Mathematical models. 

### Singularity approximation model
Definition: Singularity is point in space where everything that was, is, and will be is completely available in maximal possible resolution i.e. full information about the physical universe in single point. 

The claim here is that conscious beings are those that using their limited resources of their brain, trying to be as close to singularity as it’s possible. Trying to know everything about the past, the present and future - but fail to do so, yet there is a constant attempt to be updated and maximize knowledge about the past, the current state of physical reality and predict the future. Mindis in a sense the best approximation of singularity inside limited brain. 

### Universal simulator model
Another way to think about mindis using universality from computational theory. In computation there what’s called “virtual machine”, or a “window on desktop” inside this window we can run any software we want, including other computers hardware using virtualization layer. This property can help us formulate mindas virtual machine that has the ability to run any other simulation inside it, including other consciousnesses or different abstract notions which we weren’t developed evolutionary for (abstract mathematics). This includes any idea from reality - when we’re watching a movie, we’re basically simulating the personality of all characters. When we’re dreaming (or playing a game) we’re basically “live” inside alternative world, because our mind is capable to simulate everything that’s possible to simulate. 

Universal simulator can also be regarded as universal learner. As our mind has limited capacity, it’s not trying only to maximize memory of past events, but also to learn from the past. To generalize singular events into theories, in order to predict and understand mechanisms present in reality. This learning process is based upon universal approximator which is available to every neural net. By creating mental models, our mind is not only trying to explain and analyze the past but also to get a good understanding and ability to predict the future. So the mind is universal simulator but it’s doing so by using universal approximator in order to achieve maximal accuracy of prediction. 

### Dimension expansion model
Another mathematical way to think about mindas a constant attempt to exit to a new “dimensionality”. Think of a blind person from birth. He’s incapable to simulate others who see. He “knows” they are capable of seeing but he has no internal reference to this experience. For him everyone around are blind like him. This sort of blindness is common. For example people who have no sexual desire, will be able to observe attraction and predict behaviour but will not know what people around them actually feel, as they have no internal reference. In a subtle way we project upon others our own experiences and internal states, and our ability to answer the question “how does it feels”? Is very limited by our experiences. Every new reference experience is expanding our knowledge of the possibilities to feel different things. So mind can be viewed as point in vector space of very big dimension, which attached to some hyperplane. And every new reference experience is adding another dimension to this hyperplane, which allows exploration of life in another dimensionality. While simulations of other people, are always projected to the hyperplane limited by our current reference experiences. 

One should distinct between meta-blindness, which means a person is blind and also blindly assume everyone else are blind as he is. And meta-aware of his blindness. This means he sees the existence of another dimension which he is not capable to “feel from the inside” as he has no internal references, yet he is aware of the existence of this dimension. Being meta-aware is very important, because if a person could map all his blind spots, he could in general make an effort to eliminate some of them. This will not be possible to meta blind person, as he will not know he has no knowledge of extra dimensions. 

### Newtonian simulation model:
Think about the question how do you simulate point in the Newtonian gravity? You give different pushs into different directions. Now think that your mind is all the time solving some specific problem. Think of it as a force that pushing you to this direction you eaither resist or go to that direction and then you have a new force to a new direction. 

In mind economy there is a momentum of the collective. People play football because everyone are doing so. This is economy, and the time you spend and football is exactly the force by which it's pulling you. 

Addiction. Think when you try to get rid of some addiction you are having hard time - and this is a true force pulling you back into it. 

### Economy model:

You can see that focus of attention in groups is divided by some hierarchy around concsiousness center. Lets take for example chess players. Many people play chess, some start to play a lot of the time. Those people usualy get better and better and get to the top and deserve maximum attention from chess lovers. So you can notice attention/skill is described by attention economy. And this is the only thing there is in group organizations. 

### Social model:

Another example to think about groups and individuals is by using different social structures, and think about them as different creatures. The point is to increase the variaty of social creatures and make usual and normal evolution of them, using mathematical tools. Think democracy, anarchy, socialism, communist - and simulation-cracy. 

### Comparison of the models
The first two models, were referring to “ideal” consciousness. The strive of mindfor universality or singularity. But The last model was talking about practical limitation of doing so and the need in internal references. Mathematically speaking we’ve limited the mind from below and from above, we understood it’s limitations as well as it’s ideal state which is impossible to reach but it’s the asymptote where it converges. 

It should be noticed that universality of simulation is the potential of being anything and experiencing anything, but in reality our mind is very limited. For example a person who has no visual cortex will not be able to see, but it’s generally possible to create artificial visual cortex prostate. There is nothing conceptual which makes different blind spots, only technical execution of evolutionary developed brain. 

Also should be noticed that even if we have some blind spots, there is a language and “conceptual models”, that can help overcome the expiriencial barrier. Blind people could speak about colors in meaningful way, but they will speak about them theoretically like we speak about 10 dimensional reality and not based on personal experience. So speaking of universality today, we can talk about universal language not of experience. But this only temporal technological limitation, not a conceptual limitation of the mind itself. 

Also one should notice that having a full knowledge of the universe, will not mean being able to grasp everything at single moment, rather than having an access to database where each situation we encounter in our lives is well explored. Our mind is optimizing everything there is to know about reality into mental models that helps us to function. From practical point of view, we don’t need to be present in singularity each moment of our lives, rather we should be able to think, talk and behave as if we would have full knowledge, yet there is a big gap between the ideal state, the ideal state which is relevant for optimal actions and behaviours, and sub ideal state which is currently available to us. 

## Conclusion 

The mind is striving to simulate reality around it the best way it can, to learn from the past and predict the future in order to optimize the course of actions. While a lot of resources are spent to understand and predict other minds as well as his own, using the best intuitive theory of mind it could get. The ITOM is evolving together with learning process about other aspects of reality.
