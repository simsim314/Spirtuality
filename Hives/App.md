High level concept: 

In the hive you're encouraged to view yourself as part of the group (you also a group of yourself), and communicate with the groups and other people, by just talking to each other, debating, trying to develop your meta cognition. You're endoctronated into a place with different views, opinions, different avatars which they play with, a very role playing virtual kinda facebook but it will collect information and will have a flow downwords like in facebook but also a strong vetor upowards to hive main news. The hive is very concerned with managing itself by itself without main leader but with scoring systems which will help people make sense and groups to become more coherent by encouraging people from the group to talk. So we want people from the same group to really learn and understand other people from that group (many such projects were done for humanity or arabs-israelis). 

Each group is also encouraged to develop its language and syntax. Trying to minimize the effort to pass messages and enrich the hive language and syntax to be indepenant from any others. When you enter the hive, there is a language that takes time to get used to. But the hive words will spread faster. 

The hive has no commercials and it's supported and supports academic research of consciousness. 

Code design: 

In hive every parameter is hivable. Everyone can enter modify and add the code, and the hive will be compiled with the changes. 
Every list and every number in the code - is hivable and votable by the hive. 

You enter the Hive:
0. You downvote and upvote your own decisions. You take yourself, in different times and ask yourself to answer the question. You will get some statistics. In this way you will learn to be coherent with yourself. 

1. You are asked questions about yourself, which will predict your personality. You get your moral code, and moral path. You start with group of yourself. Every time you speak to someone, you create a group of {me, you}. This group starts to also self defining itself and helping you to define the border between you and others. 

2. You choose a topic. The topic list is evolving by the hive prefences. (News, Groups, Debates).

3. In the topic you get groups. Each group has its own rules, it will be a virtual city with its own rules and views (later on we will make sim city). 

4. In each group there is a statistic about the group, mandatory group sessions, group news. Group coherence factor, group polls. Group is also a moral path, a filosophical path and has a model of it's consiosness. 

5. In hives it's not only person to person communication, but also person to the group, the whole hive, group to a group. The polls for the talks and dicussions.
