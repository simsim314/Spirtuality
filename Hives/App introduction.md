The app or the interface will work because 

1. You will be introduced to many things, and someone will be asssigned to you to guide you (after the tutorial). 
2. It's fun to make alone. Actually making it alone is part of the things you do. You might fix your avatar or split it into two people who are consistent between themselves but inconsistent between many avatars. You can work on it every time avatar is broken. 
3. When you come you see the hive - you see the people working on some things, you get the news you get explained how it works and how it's important to understand the hive itself. Or at least understand people understand the whole hive - and get rating in it. 
4. Small group interface up to 6 people. 
5. Small company interface up to 100 people. 
6. Medium size up to 10K. 
7. Million. 
8. Billions. The whole hive.
