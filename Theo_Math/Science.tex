We can explore social systems as conscious systems inside CAs and explore their convergence through the lense of subject syntax. 

Subject has internal state and external convergence state.  The society as well. We can have one scale of utopia dystopia and the other scale is understanding reality well or not. And we as a society want to get into good understanding of objects and improving the subjects function H which is personal and ill defined properly yet the subject can define it himself and explore it in scientific tools. 

We obviously want as a society to get into utopia. 

Science and anti science. Several scales. 
Utopia dystopia. Several scales. 

Why social sciences are not converging to optimal place. Social studies might converge to dystopia. How do we classify different convergence and why it's important to have a good scientific language instead of CNNs and other convergent languages. the question is not if this is scientific but at what scale. 

sentecnes that query subject.

Studies should be morally neutral - morals definition and compilation definition. Mary room fuck up.
