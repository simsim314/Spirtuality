Welcome to focus economy solutions. 

In focus economy we don't think about what we pay and what we buy, we think about our focus and where it goes. We think that we're basically giving away limited amount of money over time, and we want to make sure we're happy with ourselves and we're happy with others. So that evreyone will be in balance between themselves. So if someone needs a doctor and I'm a doctor, but I want to sleep so the app will optimize paying the most having fun person from the hive that could help (I don't know how I still use this syntax). 

This economy is best sueted places where all other problems are solved (there is enough food), and people just want to share and be nice to each other and have fun.
