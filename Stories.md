A futuristic story of splits that become bigger and bigger and people start to get the idea and colony splot will be a big deal, like people dig it completelly to have this biological meaning to our colony like a growing organism that splits, and that this analogy will become very identifiable with, because people see this what happens. And we need to guide the eco system to understand we are only 7 bilion people or something and not to start to give prizes for having more phoones and stuff. This will need to be enforced physically, by connecting some piece of hardware in the institute to some piece of software. Like ID for example :) But this will be seen as authrosoty to have an ID, to force people to have an identity and not to be an element in the cloud? like why would you like to be an element or a number and not a person?
