Prophecy should not be seen as a factual nastardamic ideology but a probable projection of humanity to the next 100 million years at the least. You can think about it as map toward the future. 

## Prophecy 

Prophecy for the future of humanity is a project that tries to make a good mental simulation of how the future of humanity and human consciousness will look like in different time frames. And this includes billions of years into the future. 

This book called a prophecy as it’s in my opinion what prophets are intended to do. To help humanity understand it’s next steps and prepare them for it. Today this is all quete scientific, and although I don’t have a real scientific tools to back it up, the projection of the future is quete scientifically derived from other fields of consciousness exploration, and backed up by some trivial calculations that create upper bounds which can be expected to be reached in some future to some high degree. So it’s not an empty apocalyptic prophecy about the end of the world, but a projection of the future possibilities and life style using what we already know today. Maybe there will be discovered some new physics in the future, but as far as we know - and we know it very not bad at all, there is none. The assumption is that we have all the building blocks and yet to build with them something meaningful is a hard task, to understand how different blocks can fit together in the future.

In the near future, approximately in the next 100 years we are estimated to reach some sort of mental jump. To truly get out of the caves and think more like a galactic civilization rather than having a planetary mindset. The target of this book is to show people how a person from the beginning of the 21st century see myself as part of this galactic consciousness, and hopefully help other people to see this sci-fi reality unfolded in front of their eyes. The issues are also sorted by time periods very approximately. The emphasis here is to think about the possible issues and their complexity relative to one another, and to give rough estimate of time scales and have a feeling of what is possible to reach and to predict the place we as conscious being will be in 100 million years from now. 

## The methodology

When we look at a star trek episode from the 60s and from the 90s we can notice a big difference in what people missed vs. what that get right. For example people are searching for someone lost on a ship (they don’t have surveillance cameras even), but on the other hand they teleport. This brings me to the notion that we as humanity have hard time to simulate probable future events to make some stories that have real meaning in the future. I mean this is obviously hard task to do. But this is also an opportunity to learn about our consciousness? And by learning what we missed in the 60s we can learn what we tend to miss in general. 

This book is continuation to the meditation books, where the metaphysics of possibility and consciousness is explained. Here we try to maximize our quality of the understanding from meditations, and use it to predict the future of humanity using the nature of computational consciousness, in context where computations are basically free but - not completely free. New dilemmas can arise in such reality, for example creating more conscious entities that have full freedom and can’t be destroyed by a wip of some tiran. Allowing immoral behaviours toward non conscious being? Stopping being moral at all and allowing everyone use their access to the matrix as they wish? All possible dilemmas and thoughts are analyzed in this books. 

There is also a lot of influence from people who are already doing this kind of research, this is just a next step in the same thought experiment. 
The major tool of this book is too see “the final and conclusive point” of some technology, and then extrapolating it back into what we have now, and what we can expect in the near future - and in larger time scales it’s assumed every technology has reached its full potential and will focus more and the moral and social implication and possibilities which such full capacity technological advancement is allowing. 

## The near future - scale of 100 years

What we have missed - that will be completed in the next few hundred of years if we will not screw it up? To understand this we should point towards old movies, and see what they missed and got right and project it into the future. 

__Prophecy 1:__ The concept of self will become more and more integrated into a collective. Each individual will track and gets updated about the collective with increasing resolution, up to infinity. There still might be something personal and individual, but not much - more and more things about us will be sharable and trackable in lower time frames, and more and more tools will allow us to make it more and more efficiently. 

__Explanation__
We have a knowledge and sensation of a person being present somewhere in our reality. We sometimes don’t know what exactly happens currently to a person we know - but we try to keep it updated. More than that many apps today give you an option to track individuals using their smartphone GPS. So in the next future we should expect knowing the location of all our friends in real time. In general and this is not in the next 100 years, we will be able to exactly track any human being with all his neural activity with high resolution in space and time if we wish so. It won’t be free but it will be possible to track. So you see here a scale of “privacy”. People today have a lot of privacy but it’s getting less and less available.  Eventually we can feel no privacy at all at some point like animals in the forest. Another issue is our updating rate of other people. Today we are updated on social networks about many people and able to track their progress. Each human being today is basically news generator, and some news are more interesting than others and we try to track them all, with some sampling rate. 

Basically we can look at it as consciousness which like to feel to be updated about reality around it, and it succeeds in limited amount. In the future we will be able exactly how much updated we want to get about our reality and in general case can have much more approach to everything. 

Having more approach is technological issue, but the moral issue of letting someone approach us completely at any given moment is a big step. We could have some laws to limit this access to some extent - but it’s inevitable that at least technologically speaking we will be able to know everything which is open to knowledge about anyone, and this hypothetically includes everything there is possible to know about someone at all. 

Obviously this will include in the near future some chips that will among other things will track our location. But obviously will also track our health, habits, hormonal imbalances and will be able to make very good suggestion to us. 

This will also allow to end crime. Simply because if you’re caught you will be harshly punished just by giving you a wrong “tag” of a thief that everyone could see. Also everyone know what you’re thinking or doing with such a resolution so that there is no option to make unnoticed crimes. Also hopefully there will be no point in stealing as machines will provide us with all our needs or at least most of them. 

__Prophecy 2:__ We should be aware of major disasters and avoid them. It’s less a prophecy and more a realization from what technology or area of knowledge the disaster can come up, and what we should do about it. The prophecy here is that in 200 to 500 years we should be clean of all threats if we make everything right. Otherwise - if we miss some threat and it will happen, humanity will either cease to exist, or turn back into stone age. It could be that we need several attempts to make it right, and we are trying to make too large of a jump on the first attempt. 

__Explanation__

The well known and explored humanity threat list:

The atomic war followed by atomic winter. 
Biological threat from biological weapon, or natural pandemic. 
AI that will trick humanity or/and destroy it. 
Cyber attacks - that will start nuclear war. 
Environmental global disaster made by humans (global warming, pollution of air and water, cutting too much trees). 
Environmental global disaster from other sources (meteors, aliens, switch of magnetic poles etc).
Resource exhaustion - we could stay without enough resources to manage our society, prices will rise and WWIII will start sporadically with social protests. Planet without resources can’t develop further. 
Grey goo. Self replication which gets out of control (nanotechnology is the major source of concern today).


__Cyber Tyranny:__

One of options which are not considered is that in the future due to dependence on computers and technology, some company can become a Tyranny that basically uses people as slaves. Already today you see people having hard time to distinguish between reality and virtual reality, and fall off cliffs in search of pokemons. Now imagine they will also force people to make some real work in order to play a game. 

You can also see this field is unregulated. Most of the “free” games today are forcing you to watch commercial and this type of intrusion into private space doesn’t considered harmful or immoral. In the future this kind of intrusion can become a source of Tyranny. Today they just want your time or money because time is money. But tomorrow they can force you to do stuff as well. For example today already 10% of the game time is about watching commercial. But the commercials sell you games which has also 10% of the time making commercials to other games exactly like them. So we have 10% of time wasted on random commercial watching, which never ends. Now think this time will increase into not reasonable proportions, and everyone will be used to watching that much commercials (for me 10% of the time being wasted on commercial is so crazy that I delete games like that after 2-3 times playing, to never return again - but it seems many people are hooked). So people will pay a lot of money just to see 10% commercials less. Everything will become meaningless because of the amount of commercials that only make commercials to other stuff which only makes commercials. Or for example think what would happen if Microsoft will not only ask you to pay them money, but also come to their seminars once a year. In that seminar they will sell basically the same shit your government is selling you today, under the brand name Microsoft. It could have an army of loyal soldiers like ISIS, but based on the brand of Microsoft instead of Islam. 

__Meme disasters:__

Today people think about their beliefs (memes) as an absolute truth. Absolute enough to be able to kill or be killed for. One example is your country - you believe in this imaginary entity so much that you feel you must fight for it, and even die for it. The examples here include all the wars made by civilizations, including Hitler and WWII as an extreme example of meme spreading making everyone crazy Nazists and feeling fine about it. But this could also be a second coming of Jesus Christ that will bring upon us an apocalyptic end, by WWIII among different religions. So this is a real threat made by making a lot of people believe in something which will make them kill each other in too large quantities. 

The growing generation approach to knowledge is completely differently. The knowledge is way too much available, and people understand there is no one truth, and they should not even have one opinion about anything, let alone thinking this opinion is a single truth. Each individual starts to think as a collective, as having several competing opinions with some different probabilities for them to be correct. The probabilities are personal, but the idea of no single truth but many is long coming. You can see this change in physics. Up to 19th century everyone had behold the same truth about reality, one single minded truth which was discovered by Newton. Since then we see a variety of opinions about the basic questions of reality, and the more time passes the more difficult is to reach a conclusion. And even if physics will converge, we will still have this memory of how we behave when the truth is not available in some area of expertise? And there is only opinions on many topics. 

The closed minded approach will disappear soon, but before that - many people still today feel they have one true belief about the nature of the reality itself, and someone can use this dogmatic approach to generate memes that will lead to WWIII, and end humanity or civilization as we know it. Think of second coming and Hitler in the same sentence. 

This is solved problem in consciousness discipline. We know how to teach and raise a generation that will not be susceptible to this kind of mistakes. We know less and less people today are falling to this kind of propaganda crap. But there are still plenty of those. 

__Overpopulation disaster:__

Another trivial issue in this book is overpopulation regulations. Unlike other threats that should be simply avoided, overpopulation should be regulated forcefully from some point on. This is obvious conclusion from mematic theory. 

Divide the population of humanity into groups by number of kids they want to have. Think of those groups as belonging into sort of personal religion. The claim is that in the long run any belief which states more than two kids is not survivable. But evolutionary speaking, the group with higher base in the exponent will have more offsprings in the long run. So humanity is working very wisely not controlling by force the populations of their country, and using logic to explain people why this is bad. But some people will not buy this explanations - and as with any belief system there will be outcasts. Those outcasts with time and without regulation will become the majority of humanity because exponent is simple math, and there is no way around it. So having more than two kids, believing in it and acting upon this belief - will benefit the belief itself in the long run. It will spread with humanity - the way around it will be explained in future paragraphs, as this theme will become major factor in the prediction for millions of years ahead, and the concept of regulated population is regarded as obvious. 

I think Israel is the only country currently that has this threat predominating its future, but most of the countries will follow. Israel in the next 50 years will be occupied by religious groups that have a strong belief that 6 to 8 kids is the right size of a family. Today they constitute 8% percent of the population but at age group of 6, they constitute 25% of their age. Simple math can’t be overthrown with dogmatic religious belief of any kind. And for this group the belief of having more kids is something which is part of their religion, so this religion should be regulated as well. And everyone knows how religious Jewish groups react to authority and reason (basically they prefer to die). 

__Prophecy 3:__ Merging with virtual reality. The full extent of this technology is still not had been fully depicted yet. 

Explanation

In the next 100 years we can expect augmented reality as part of our daily lives. Maybe we will have implants that will make reality and virtual reality indistinguishable at least using the well explored sensors like sound and vision. But it’s also possible to have implants that will create sensory signals according to virtual reality. The only limitation is to actually have physical barriers. We can create something which blocks the muscle movement in “forbidden zones”, but blocking the muscle movement with the sensory feeling of touch is not the same as having real physical object blocking the way. This is a small nuance but it’s an important one. 

In further future (probably under 250 years) we can expect full merging between virtual and physical reality. We will not distinguish the two that well, yet will know the rules of the “extended” reality - and they will be limited by physical laws. For example we can’t request random intense computational tasks. We can’t ask our virtual computer to simulate for us a very realistic crowd build out of millions of people, for free. So we will have currency which is measured by computational power, and we can expect to have any feeling or imagination presented to us in augmented reality, or with direct messages to the mind approach (like in a dream) we can be emerged fully into virtual reality where everything feels real but it’s our own mind. 

How this reality will look like? In the next paragraphs it will be explained better, as this is not trivial question. For now just imagine that every movie you watch, every character in any movie, can be realistically simulated to present a very precise and realistic description of it, and you can have complete and accurate simulation of that character and interaction with it. Or you can go to “dream mode” and have fully emerged interaction that includes all small physical nuances that are not working well in physical reality. In the dream mode you get into a place where there are no rules except the costs to simulate different realities with different rules, and people are playing and enjoying them. For example you could easily play the role of superman in dream mode, but in reality even if you would be able to fly, it will probably require some equipment even if it would be possible (but probably won’t). 

In this dream reality we don’t have to have a body - we can also chose to have a body. Our body image in that reality will fluid. Everyone will look like as they please, some people even will try to develop 4 dimensional intuitions and feel as they are in higher dimensions. Yet until we will be able to play with our mind freely after mind uploading this will be very limited. 

Another option of this merging is westworld reality where some artificial dolls are occupying the body and controlled by mechanics or bio-mechanics. The only difference is that the movement of those dolls will be controlled by some computer that will make sure they are not conscious. Some crime can be done by simulating consciousness, or making such dolls conscious on purpose out of ill intent (or on the contrary someone had fallen in love in one of the dolls). 

__Prophecy 4:__ Rising from the dead. As part of merging with virtual reality, we would be able to simulate every person that lived before us. We would be able to realistically simulate every imaginary entity as well. It’s more in range of the next 250 years, but it’s obvious next step of good computational power, and merging with virtual reality. 

Explanation

This is obviously a huge project very similar to human genome but with all human knowledge, imagination, stories, and documents available today. This is trivial that we would prefer to talk and be present in real life simulation of interaction between different personalities, rather than reading books about them, or watching it in a show. Shows are basically the best parts of simulations of interactions between people and other entities with emphasis on “good parts”. But as general rule of thumb there is no need in simulating them very very accurately only with some marginal precision. We would basically extract all our history and place it on disk, and allow approach to it for everyone. Think “the internet” and the library of single life depicted in  Ready Player One.

The project will obviously consist of several steps. First we will learn to simulate very precisely human behaviour in general, we will have a good models of human mind. Then we will use those models in order to simulate in high quality different people and entities which are not part of physical reality, and make those simulation very precise. We will probably move back in time, while when we be simulating Shakespeare, we will need to simulate realistically all his imaginary characters as well. 

__Prophecy 5:__ Artificial intelligence which solves vast majority of the problems better than most humans can be expected in the next 100 years. Assuming we solved the issue of concealed ill intent from the machines, or simply ill design that can overthrow the human race.  

Explanation

Today people are doing most of the work in society. Our economy is built upon this model - we give some to society and get paid according to some dynamic system evaluation of our contribution using the free market. This is idealistic view - because in capitalism there are also property owners, and they get paid just because of how money works today, and I see it as a problem because as an owner you don’t produce anything. So the owner should be the customer, and his money should go directly to the people who invest effort and made it possible. Obviously this is not simple task for projects that are still in their infancy - to recruit money from potential customers, but this is possible - it’s called crowdfunding. 

Yet still in the next 100 years most of humanity will become purely consumers. Every human will have some amount of virtual currency except of his own time, and he will not be able to produce more value by working on his own, only to prioritize different project by investing his time (and virtual currency) into them. We will be the judges of social projects not the executors as machines will do the job for us much more efficiently. All of our time will be leisure time, and we will do and be part of many projects that will play with humanity and it’s options. You can say we will only play games, watch realistic movies, and truly enjoy life as much as possible and this will be it. 

Religions as they are today will be obsolete, but maybe religions will be replaced by some other social construct that promote some sort of meaning and spiritual and psychological growth. Maybe some leftovers will remain - someone will continue invest some effort into old religions because it’s what they like doing. But even there it will be much differently - if you can revive every holly person from the past it’s obvious the religious studies will be modified by then. 

Our schools will also become obsolete as they are today. Children will not need to learn anything to get good jobs. There is no need in good grades, only as a tool for the kids themselves to make sure they understand the subject they interested in learning. It’s a hard question how much force will be needed to push kids into learning real stuff instead of playing very degenerated games. Yet we can be sure there will be no argument of “you must learn to have a better job”, as there will be no jobs left. We will push kids to experience more, to travel the world, to travel the virtual world, to see places, to speak with people, to listen to a lot of lectures on many different topics, just in order to have good realization of who they are and how did they get there, as this is human nature wanting to know those things. 

Another important thing to remember, if humanity will be able to create an AI this will mean our limitation will be physical ones in their essence, and not intelectual. We will advance much faster from that point on - so the other issues which are approximated to happen in 500-1000 years could be accelerated by AI. 

__Prophecy 6:__  Free electricity. Energy will be solved problem due to cold fusion. 

Explanation

The implications are obvious. Cold fusion looks very close to execution, some scientists promise reactors by 2030. 

__Prophecy 7:__ Transportation be a local issue. 

Explanation

Because people today are working, and because our virtual capabilities are of low quality people are expected to work from the office. Not only there will nothing to do, there will be an option to virtually teleport to some other place and everyone else will be connected to the cloud and will be able to see you in that physical place. Physical place itself will play some role, as we want at least from time to time meat our friend and family, and the central physical location is more optimal and therefore physical centers will cost much more. How would we prioritize if everyone has the same amount of virtual currency? 

For starters some people could have still jobs. Maybe it will be 2-3% of the population but they will probably will be expected to live in the center as their mental capabilities might be needed in parallel with their physical presence. Another option would be that people will be left to live where they are living currently at some point of the “revolution” and from that point on their movement will be part of some algorithms, so the people living in the center will be simply the lucky ones to happen to live there in the right time. It’s also possible to imagine that physical reality will be so devoluted, that the prices for central locations will be significantly low, and it will be only the matter of few percent from the virtual currency that people will not like to pay in order to live in the center, as the virtual presence will be their main communication tool. Also there is an option that transportation will be so rare, that some delivery network will bring you from any point to any point in the world for extremely low price. 

Yet still the transportation issues are interesting topic. It’s not a simple one to answer as it’s not clear the value of physical world in that reality. How many people will want to be disconnected for example, still living old fashion lives like Hamish? Maybe some communities will prefer to be fully emerged into some role playing real life games, without any virtual reality at all? Hard to say. See also the open cities project. 

__Prophecy 8:__  Genetically modified humans influencing society in various direction. 

Explanation

We already have first experiments. In the next years we can expect some countries regulating this topic, and allow parent to choose genetic traits of their children. We can also expect social movement of parent that raise their own clones. Governments will start experiment on raising the perfect soldiers for each role. Public debates on this topic, and questions of morality. This is obviously immoral because governments are immoral and we need to switch to cities system. But we already have cloning and genetic modification and we still have goverments and armies - so modified soldiers are inevitable. But will probably not be used - as military robots come first. 

__Prophecy 9:__ End of wars. 

Explanation

This is very optimistic prediction thinking that humanity will overcome a complete stupidity of dying for ideas which worth way less than a single life of any individual. Nevertheless I truly believe people already today don’t use atomic bombs, and civilians mass murdering like in WWII, yet still it exist in places like Syria. Humanity will get the idea that resolving disputes without civilian casualties is pointless, because no one will care what result will end some “virtual” fight of two armies of robots and no one will be crazy enough to go there themselves and die under heavy fire of enemy robots. So war will be pointless and there will be no way to force anything on anyone with reasonable cultural and military level. 

## The next 250 years

__Prophecy 10:__ Eradication of biological diseases and death. 

Explanation

Most of the people living today are dying from diseases at their 80s. This is very unfortunate evolutionary remanence, as we’re treated currently by reality as biological species - which we currently still are. But as conscious being we take death very close to the heart, as we should - because death of conscious being is like death of a whole universe. It’s also one of the things which holding us back - to learn some minimal amount of knowledge about reality takes time and effort, this effort takes tens of years to learn from nothing to each individual, and as we’re still production culture this means we waste a lot of energy to train again and again people what many old people already know. 

Our medicine is currently advanced as much as we can basically simulate everything which is happening in single cell. We can simulate a lot of diseases and develop a cure in short amount of time. Some of the viruses and other “biological machines” still outsmart us but not for long. At the moment AI will reach some reasonable level in the next 50 years tops, we will see how every problem is solved elegantly by those machines. It shouldn’t be even general intelligence AI. This is probably just the next big thing after automated vehicles.

Mind virtualization 

Another viable option in the range of 500 years is mind virtualization. This means you eat a pill, and some of your neurons replaced by nano neurons which are self healing and work exactly like the physical ones you have. You do it gradually - every day few hundred thousand, so you don’t pay attention how you become a cyborg. Then you just upload this brain structure into the internet as your brain at some point will become fully artificial.
