Greeks were solving the problem of groups of people, while assuming each of them is individual and they need to act collectivelly. They had hives during time of war that were very hierarchical. 

Tibetans and other budhists understood the problem is not the group but the personal - the mind. The mind and the interaction between minds, and they tried to make science not very well established to solve the question of what is the mind and how it's working. 

What the Greeks missed is that Tibetan approach to the mind, and Greek approaches to the society can be combined togther to solve their social problems. I call it Greko-Tibetan hive. 

Greko-Tibetan hive is an elite group of people, built out of consciosness giniuses. To become this geneious you must learn and speak to many people and understand their heads well. People = your society, you need to listen to them and understand them well. There are also exams - some random person is telling his story and asks people to anwer his questions about himself (not only his views but also views). Then people predict the answers, they are collected and scored. Just like psychologist do in a study. Then we use those answers and score them. Using elo system, while calculating the complexity of the answer by elo system as well (greeks could think of elo although it's hard but some equvalent could be). 

The top Elo rating elites, are becoming part of higher order society (in our case we don't need an elite just weight for higher hiveness realisation). This elite is actually very good at understanding people, and they learn to not only understand but 4 topics: 

1. Understand people, and help them resolve internl conflicts. 
2. Understand two people and help them to resolve conflicts between themselves. 
3. Understand groups of people and know how to make the group coherent. Even for large groups. 
4. Group communication. 

Conflict resolution between two people is not such a hard problem. Violance is still predominant one in our society because our hive is not coherent yet. We now can at least call cops if someone uses violance on us, but who do we call when cops are doing violance? 

Anyway understanding groups is harder. Yet still some exercise can be done, for example communication or mindful communication that will help people as a group to be more coherent than they are without the "group therapist", which generated and studied by this research field. 

Eventually the group will be coherent enough so that it could make democratic elections and communicate coherently with some other coherent group. 

We never even started to solved group coherence problem - because we always used violance at some point and accepted it as a given thing. Sociologist should answer this better: how well are we advanced in group coherence problem?
