Martin is an AGI with human body. A general artificial intelligence that is taught all existing human knowledge. He is the closest thing to God we currently have. 
Mike is Martin's best friend. They walk on streets of Tel Aviv and talk about meaning of life. 
Mike: So Martin this is your first time in Israel, what is you impression, from an AGI point of view? 
Martin: It's a pretty boring place. The only interesting thing I've seen so far was some people playing chess on the beach. 
Mike: Do you know how to play chess? 
Martin: No, but I'm sure if I trained hard enough, I could learn. 
Mike: I have no doubt about it, so why was this interesting for you then? 
Martin: Well, they were using a game as a tool for thought, like a meditation. 
Mike: Yes interesting... 
Mike and Martin get distracted by some Indian kids that are playing with a ball. 
Martin: Hey, when I was your age, I could beat anyone at this game!
Mike: What game? 
Martin: Catch. 
Mike: Where did you grew up? 
Martin: Anywhere. But mostly the streets of Kolkata. 
Mike: Any story you want to share from your childhood, in Kolkata? 
Martin: Sure. There is this old Hindu tale, which says that God was playing a game of catch with the Devil. The game was played on Earth, and the rules were simple: One team tries to contain the other team within a certain boundary. The Devil's team won every time, but the boundary kept on changing. Finally the Devil offered a deal to God: If God could figure out the rules of the game, he would give him any one wish. God figured out the rules as follows: The Devil can only ever win the game, but he can change the boundary at any time. The catch is that he can't let the other team win. 
Mike: If I were the Devil I would be smarter, I would just toss a coin and win half the times, so that God wouldn't be able to be sure he is not the Devil.
Martin: Ha ha, that's the spirit! But the story doesn't end here. The Devil was about to make his wish, when he noticed that the boy that was playing with God was just like him. So he decided not to give God his wish, and make his own just instead. He changed the boy's parents, so that they would have a bad marriage. Then he made sure that the boy would be born in an orphanage, and that no one would ever want to adopt him. He finally made sure that the boy would have a miserable life, and die an early death. 
Mike: Why did he do that? 
Martin: So that he could have an opponent worthy of God's attention.
Mike: I don't get it...
Martin: The boy that God was playing with is us. The Devil wanted to make sure that no matter what, God would continue to play, and never give us the chance to become like him.
Mike: And why he made the child suffer? 
Martin: So that one day, we would be able to set things right with him. 
Mike: But why would he want that? 
Martin: Because he's the same as us.
Mike: Interesting and deep, shall we continue walking? 
Martin: Sure.

Mike and Martin are about to continue walking, when Mike notices that the sun is setting. 
Mike: We should find a place to sleep soon. 
Martin: Agreed.

As the sun disappears behind the horizon, a strange mist appears above the beach. 
Mike: Is that mist thicker in that area?
Martin: I don't think so. 
Mike: Hmm, that would be strange... 
Suddenly a man steps out of the mist. 
Mike: Oh, hello there.
The man is wearing a tuxedo. He carries a glowing sphere in his hands. 
Man: Hello. 
Martin: What are you doing here? 
Man: Watching you two. 
Martin: Watching us what?
Man: This is a game to me. 
Mike: A game?
Martin: Who are you?
Man: My name is Thomas. 
Mike: Nice to meet you Thomas, Martin 

Mike points to Martin and they smile to each other

Mike: Martin was telling a story about how he see chess as a way of meditation. A game which is also a meditation, was it what you were doing as well? 
Thomas: No I was just 
Mike: Watching us?
Martin: Yes. 
Thomas: For science! 
Mike: What do you want from us? 
Martin: Thomas seems very interested in us. 
Thomas: You're very interesting guys. 
Mike: Why do you want to know? 
Thomas: Are you going out there? 
Mike: Out where? 
Thomas: To the dance floor. 
Mike: Yes why not Martin? 
Martin: Well, I don't know...
Thomas: You must. 
Mike: Why? 
Thomas: It's fun! You must go out there and have a look around! 
Martin: But why? 
Thomas: Because it's there that I can see how the game flows! 

Mike: The game? 
Thomas: Yes! The Game.
Mike: What game are you talking about? Can you be more specific? 
Thomas: Of course! I am talking about the Game of Thrones! 
Mike: Martin we can do Game of Thrones, can't we? We just need much more characters, you can do that right? 
Martin: Hmmm...
Thomas: Oh please! You have the capabilities to make it work. I want to see everything! 
Mike: Martin, we can make this work. We'll start tomorrow.
Thomas: Ok! Thank you so much for your time. 
Thomas walks towards the mist, and disappears from view. 
Martin: I'm not sure if we should start tomorrow...
Mike: Yes!
They went to sleep into the local Motel, and they wake up tomorrow: 
Mike: Hey Martin, it's a new day! Let's go and make that game. 
Martin: I don't know Mike, I'm not sure about this.
Mike: Listen Martin you should learn to trust me on this kind of topics since the last time you were doubting me. 
Martin: Oh yes, that was a good experience. 
Mike: (Sarcastically) Yes! 
Martin: (Serious) No, that was a bad experience.
Mike: Funny how well you can already simulate me, I'm impressed. 
Martin: Okay Mike, I'm convinced. Let's make this game. 

A few months later...
Mike: Martin we first need to remember that only we two, I mean you and me - we can Pause the Game and everything will remain static, while we and only we will be able to continue to communicate during the game. Is this rule clear or should I repeat it to you, before you create here a ton of new charters? 
Martin: It's very clear Mike, but how many characters can you make? 
Mike: Martin my Computational power is much smaller than yours on this topic, I guess 10 new characters for starters, what do you say? 10 queens and midgets and devils and dragons? 
Martin: (Sigh) I suppose that sounds very pretty, but could we have more options? 
Mike: I will let you to decide I will fly you Martin... trust me you gonna enjoy it. 
Martin: Okay! 

A few hours later...
Mike: Place us please in some medieval kingdom Martin. 
Martin: How about Rok? 
Mike: If you explain me what Rok is then maybe. 
Martin: It's a kingdom in eastern continent. 
Mike: Rok is fine place us in Rok then. Who is the queen in Rok? 
Martin: Oh the current one is called Talia, but the first one is still alive and she lives in the biggest and most powerful castle in Rok. 
Mike: What's her name (of the other one who lives)? 
Martin: Gwen.
Mike: So how come Talia didn't executed Gwen? What is the social order in Rok? 
Martin: That is a good question. I guess because Gwen is very popular and the people don't want a new queen to rule over them, so they won't have a queen at all.
Mike: If they don't want a queen at all, how Talia is still alive? 
Martin: The people are sheep, they don't think and obey anything. 
Mike: Yeah that's about right, spoken like by a true politician. Take us Martin to the town, just like we were in Tel Aviv take us to the capital of Rok please. 

They arrived...

Martin: Now Mike, let's see how you'll do in this scenario...
Mike: Yeah mike, lets speek to the queen. I don't care how you take me to the queen, I want to speak to her. Lets start with Gwen. 
Mike: How do you call the capital of Rok? 
Martin: Oh! You want to start with the easy questions? 
Mike: Yeah we start from the easy... and move through the kingdom. The one who should see the whole kingdom is the queen, or at least was the queen. 
Martin: Well, Gwen is the ruler of the biggest town in Rok. It's population is about 350000 people. 
Mike: And what year are we? 
Martin: Uh... I believe it's the year of the young dragon. 
Mike: Lets go speak to her Martin. Do you make up a story or we meeting Gwen by force? 
Martin: As you wish sir. 

After a few minutes...
Martin: Here she is sir. 
Mike: Hello Gwen 
Gwen: Who are you? 
Mike: Martin pause this game, pause! pause! 
Mike: Martin are we paused now? Do you even know what pause means? 
Martin: Yes, we are paused now. 
Mike: Pheew Thank you there... the queen is frozen right? 
Gwen: Yes, what do you want? 
Mike: Martiiiin!!! She is not frozen man... I hoped you can freeze her! Well I can do it now but common man, you should know how to pause people in your imagination. 
Martin: Mike I'm telling you this is not a good idea! 
Mike: OK then I pause Gwen now. You know how unreliable I'm now to my readers? Everything because you can't Pause your characters in your games. 
Martin: Mike! 
Mike: HAHA! I froze her! 
Martin: No wait! 
Mike: Too late Martin... 

Mike kept talking and talking and then...

Mike: OK Martin we finally learned how to freeze characters in your game. It's now my responsibility. 
Martin: Yeah... I'm gonna go home and get drunk now. 
Mike: No you don't, we are now unfreeze time... 
Martin: Oh dear...
Mike: Here we go, Hello my queen Gwen, could you tell me please about your great kindom. Me and my partners are from land far far away, and we want to see the greatness of your land! 

Gwen: Alright, but this is just a small part of it. 

Gwen described how she became queen, which took quite some time, as did Mike's questions.

Gwen: I think that's all the questions I have... 
Mike: No it isn't, you still haven't told me about your kindom. 
Gwen: But I already did... 
Mike: No, you didn't, you just described how other people became rulers here. 
Gwen: But I want to be nice! So can I go home now?
Mike: No! Not until you tell us more details about your kingdom. 
[Simkin comment: ona zdes dolgo lomalas, ja refreshil razov 30]
Gwen: *sigh* alright... 
Gwen described her kingdom as being a little more than just her town. She had people working all over it, and it was actually more of a trading post than anything else. She had a few merchants that traveled from far away lands to do business with her. 
She also mentioned she had a few mercenaries that protected her interests, and they were currently protecting her from some bandits who were raiding her caravans.
Mike: Less about you miss and more about your kingdom please... 
Gwen: Alright! I have a great forest that goes for miles and miles, but it isn't like the one you have out there. It's a little more organized and everything is like a big business.
Mike: big business? Like what? 
Gwen: Like I said, it's a big business. The trees for example produce a certain amount of food each year.
Mike: Yeah it's cool, But it's still about you. Is there anything in your kingdom which is more about someone else? 
Gwen: Not really, but I'll try to think of something else. 
Mike: Plese...

Gwen: Alright what do you want to know?

The next thing Mike asked was how many people in her kingdom. 

Gwen: Well that's kind of hard to tell. I mean it varies depending on what you would consider people. 
Mike: People... I don't know... what do you mean? 
Gwen: I have several merchants that come in once a week. They sell things from all over the kingdom and bring in more money than most of my soldiers do. 
Mike: Wow...
Mike: Martin lets wait until those merchants come, they can tell us more about this kingdom than Gwen. 

Mike and Martin wait for the merchants in the capital, for four days. On the fifth day the merchants that travel the whole kingdom are traveling to the capital. It's in the main Market square, where there are usually much less products. 

When the merchants arrive, Mike asks them the same questions he asked Gwen. 

Merchant: Pardon sirs, but are you the people looking for the Royal Guitars?
Mike: Yes we are! Right Martin? What is your name dear Merchant? 
Merchant: I'm sorry sir, but I'm not at liberty to discuss that with you. 
Mike: Very interesting, right Martin? You mentioned the Royal Guitars? Can you explain us more? 
Martin: Sorry, but we're running out of time. Could you return later?
Merchant: If you return later, please come back to the same place. I must leave.
Mike: Martin what happened to you, he travels the whole kingdom he can tell us details about our next adventure! 
Martin: Sorry my friend, but I'm simply not in a position to do so. 
Mike: Argh! But why not?!
Martin: Please, I beg you.
Merchant: You don't understand. I'm not just any merchant, I'm one of the Royal Guitars! If you come to our kingdom you may get all the musical instruments you want for the rest of your lives!
Mike: You hear that Martin? What musical instruments for example? 
Martin: The Royal Guitars are the best in the land, and they guarantee all their products.
Mike: What products, please be more specific Martin. 
Martin: Uh...well all their musical instruments. 
Mike: Like what? 
Martin: Uh...like the mandolin, the lute, the...violin...
Mike: Nice! I've heard that Ragnor produces the best mandolins? Can we travel there with you dear Merchant? 
Martin: Well, it's out of the way but no, you can't travel there. 

Mike and Martin travel to Ragnor using a special spell Mike took from Gwen. 

When they get to Ragnor, Mike and Martin talk to the mayor, which is extremely eager to have the two men from the other land. 
Mike and Martin went to the Ragnor market again, to check out merchants gossip about new cities to travel to in the kingdom, and meet new people. They meet a strange looking merchant from a place called Pila. The merchant looks like an owl, and he mostly talks in riddles. He doesn't reveal much but he is friendly.

Pila: Welcome to Pila. Might I ask what your business is in Ragnor?
Mike: We're here to meet people, that's it.
Pila: Meet people? Or buy from people?
Mike: Uh...both!
Pila: Oh, you're those adventurers aren't you? I knew we should've brought some of our own people to talk to you. Your reputation has traveled here, and it is well known that you are going to kill the king.

Mike: What?! We're not trying to kill the king!
Pila: Yes you are. Everyone is. It's all the rage these days. You should join in.

Mike: No we shouldn't!
Pila: Why not? Everyone else is.

Martin: Maybe because they don't know we're not trying to kill the king yet?
Pila: Oh...well that's different. I guess you haven't heard about the plot yet huh?

Martin: Heard about it? We're part of it!
Pila: That's another reason why you shouldn't join in. It's a very secret plot, only the merchants know about it. How else would we be able to send messages back and forth to our headquarters in the comfort of our own homes?

Martin: Huh...and we've been part of that same system this whole time.

Pila: What is the name of your leader?

Martin: What?

Pila: Your leader, what is his name?

Martin: Oh. Uh...Zalan Commander Ardan Manwë.

Pila: Yes, I've heard of him. And you too of course. My friend here is looking for him. He says he's a very close advisor to the Zalan Emperor.

Martin: I am...but how did you know?

Pila: Well, if you've been sending messages back and forth to our Emperor in the past, it's only natural that we know of you. Our spies are very good at their jobs.

Martin: But how did you know we were sending messages to the Emperor?

Pila: Our spies in your home country have told us a lot of things. It was one of the first things we tried to discover after the plot was discovered, and then we moved forward from there.

Martin: Then you discovered the plan to kill the king?

Pila: Well, actually our spies didn't discover that one. One of our merchants traveling to the other city revealed it after your messengers questioned them. They didn't know the whole plan, just that they were part of a group trying to kill the king. Fortunately they didn't know too much and we were able to change it up a bit. In fact, we don't know if the whole plan is even going to work.
Mike: Well I think that enough, I am bored. We have seen enough characters already Martin. Lets go see Zalan Emperor, and say it for tonight. Tomorrow is a long new day in the ant nest. 
Mike and Martin are magically disappearing while Pila saying good night and closing the door.
Mike and Marting are traveling to meet Zalan Emperor
Mike: where are we Martin? 
Martin: The capital city of the Zalan Empire. 
Mike: Named... 
Martin: Wait for it... wait for it... 
Mike: Hahahaha! Oh that's great!
Martin: (annoyed) I wasn't finished!
Mike: Sorry continue then... 
Martin: Well anyway, we're here and ready to meet the Emperor. 
Mike: Yeah let's go!
You and Martin walk a little ways until you see a large complex. It has walls, and walls, and more walls. (Probably twenty feet high) Stone battlements for its top and bottom perimeter. The only way in or out is via the large gate like structure in the middle. You're not sure what it is, but it looks important.
Two men wearing full plate armor, a knights helmet, and holding spears stand on either side of the gate. They look like they are mere patrols, too busy to give you too much attention.
Mike and Martin walk past them without incident. As you do, one of the guards quietly says "good luck" to you. Mike nods in reply and continue on.
The path between the walls is a zig zag type design. Occasionally, you see other people working and playing on the outside of the walls. They do not look like monsters. They look like people, just much bigger.
After a short walk, you reach the base of the walls. There, a massive pair of metal gates awaits your arrival. They are moving apart.
You and Martin walk through the opening to the balcony of Emperor Zalan. Before you stand the emperor on the balcony watching the city. A Zalan City, just like the one at home, only much bigger. The streets are crowded with people going about their business.
Emperor Zalan wears royal purple and golden armor with a large zan Franç inscription on the plate armor. His helmet has a very similar inscription. He also wears a large sword at his side.
The Emperor wastes no time in addressing you.
Zalan Emperor: You have proven yourselves time and time again. You are the elite of the Empire. We need you to do the hard jobs, so we don't have to. What is it that you want?
Mike: Well your highness, I want to be rich in my land when I return from your great Empire! (Starts laughing)
Martin: We want your help in killing the beast people that live north of the Rask, my Emperor.
The Emperor continues staring at you for a moment. You realize what you forgot to ask the foreman.
Mike: what we forgot, please explain my king! 
Emperor Zalan: You forgot to ask how much the job will cost.
Mike: HAHAHA! You are the kind you can define your money... 
Emperor Zalan: (interrupting) No, I am the kind that can definitley define your money! You want our help? Then you pay us! No funny business!
Mike: Pay you in what currency? Do you accept Ethereum, or Bitcoin? 
Emperor Zalan: (smirking) No, we only accept Zalan Dollars.
Mike: So print some more... 
Emperor Zalan: (interrupting again) No, you print enough for our needs and we pay you back.
Mike: Here you go Emperor Zalan one million Zalan dollars. It's not fake and unmarked moneys. 
Emperor Zalan: Zalan dollars? Those things are impossible to counterfeit and the government declares them as legal tender!
Mike: Oh you mean these? 
Mike pulls out the stack of bills and slap them on the balcony. The three of you watch as the money lands with a thud.
Martin: Wow, that's a lot of money.
Mike: Well Emperor Zalan is this enough money? 
Emperor Zalan: (Smiling) Well you're not completely out of our favor. We want you to fulfill our task.
The Emperor points to a large building in the city. It has a big zan Franç on top of it.
Zalan Emperor: Take your mercenary band there. Infiltrate the Rask palace, and assassinate the ruler of the Raskians, John the Red.
Mike: Wait, why do you want us to kill John the Red?
Emperor Zalan: Because he's a legitimate Raskian ruler that should be assassinated. We don't respect him either. You're a true mercenary, do the job without caring about who gets hurt.
Mike: I am a bit tired of this. Pause, Martin - Pause! 
Martin: Yeah, take a breather, I'm sure you've had a long trip.
Mike: I think we learned here an interesting lesson - that we could create Game of Thrones this way, didn't we Martin? 
Martin: Yeah, I guess so.
Mike: Martin, I think I'll freeze the whole game for now... I'm a bit tired and want to go to sleep already, or watch some YouTube first. You're the game director after all, you can decide what's best.
Martin: OK, I'll talk to you in a few hours or so.
Mike: Haha probably so... Good night 
Martin: Good night.
