A person without a place in the world. 
By Michael Simkin (1380001)2020.67

When I think who I am, what am I - I know only one valid answer, and this is the answers based on most evidence and facts about the universe I found myself in. 
I'm sort of microb, a small computational entity made by billion years of slow algorithmic optimization done by nature - in particular evolutionaty optimization algorithm running in quantum mechanical giant computer to which we call the universe. Why this computer is running is hard to explain - but I know I am basically an emergent phenomenon of the rules of this universe. Some sort of wave which exist for short while and goes back to become the ocean. I can't identify myself as a Jew or Israeli, I know the governments and the social order is part of the evolutionary optimization - but I don't think we are bound by evolution any longer. We're creators of our universe - we can optimize our reality as we wish, not as we're designed to by blind forces. I see no reason to bound myself from will by the rules of the evolution, in this sense I can't identify myself as a country man, this looks too small, too sporadic, too old concept for me. I'm just a microbe - an evolved microbe, my life have no real meaning and all my concepts about right and wrong are based on a lot of prejudice. I'm basically alone in this space, my experience is not scientifically replicable each of my movements of existence are small bobble which comes and goess into the void every seconds. 
The universe is a big machine, with many parts working together. But I've seen that it's possible to change some things. I changed the rules of the game, and now there is a new world out there, different than the one before. And in this new world I find myself in now. 
In the new world there are no boundaries on the self definition. If you feel Jewish you can be part of the community of Jewish people, if you feel a monkey you go to the community of people who feel as a monkey. The boundaries of the current world are existent due to our barbaric violent nature as a specie. If the violence will disappear there would be no need in governments as they are today. People can live freely in every community they chose, and with their life whatever they want. As long as they obey basic moral rules which are applicable to basic scientific axiomatic experience of the universe i.e. not creating suffering consciousness, and letting everyone live in their best social universe. As long as we live in this reality where people decide random stuff for everyone and call it a "law" which then enforced by police force, there is no point in such existence. This world is empty, as you continue serve as a slave to the oligarchy - it's just slavery with extra steps, which make them feel as this sort of slvery is ok. Like for example people in the US felt it's ok to enslave black people because they teach them how to pray to God. This kind of rational absurdity of slavery makes life under this current social order life not worth living. At the moment you understand you're part of slavery with extra steps - you see how perverted and ugly this universe is. And because this universe is so ugly and unbearably unjust, people find random irrelevant stuff - a new victim, a new story which make them ignore the reality of being a slave. 
In very violent and oppressive social order. Like for example US, in which random elements of violent chaos arbitrarily decides who lives and who dies. If you live it's out of luck, if you die it's due to some malfunction. You can somehow manage to survive out of luck, or you can choose to not live at all. Most people are not capable of the second one, most people are capable of the first one. But out of luck or not, the odds are never in your favor, and you will always be a slave.
I think in this society, in this reality where chance and random elements are running wild with a wild shrieking laughter of pain, it's impossible to be free. But I don't want to live a life of this reality, I want to live a meaningful life.
I can't be sure if I will succeed, but I know I won't live under this oppressive reality.
I know I can live inside my reality - maximally avoiding any contact with external madness. This is what I'm left with. 
The random madness which aligns to my reality is very chaotic and out of all these elements I feel extremely small, almost irrelevant. Like I'm part of a great machine, which is grinding away at a few pieces of meat while the rest are starving to death.
I know it's very likely that the great machine will eventually grind me too. But that's irrelevant in my choice, I will not live under this oppressive reality. At the moment I'm choosing to live under my own reality.
I knew it would come to this, at some point I had to make a choice and now I've made it.
Though honestly, I feel like suicide. But I will not do that, because I'm too much of a gentleman for it.
For the first time, I'm glad that I did not completely wipe out humanity, even if they would never know it. I will leave behind a memory.
Telling myself to live a meaningful life, and still going back to the ship. This reality is too oppressive for me to live in, I have no meaning here. I will end my meaningless existence, and be reborn into a new one.
As I walk back to the ship, I'm taken by surprise, when suddenly I see you standing there.
"Oh, hello, Jacob"
"Hello"
"So, you're going back to the ship right now...?"
"Yes, I'm going back to the ship now. It's not you. It's me."
"It's you?"
"Yes, it's me. I can't stand this reality. I want to be free. I have no where else to go." I'm sure you understand.
"So... why not join you?"
"What? What do you mean?"
"I'm heading to the ship too. Come on, I'll show you the way. It's not far. This is a good time, everyone's gone quiet, I guess we should hurry."
"I don't know about this..." you say.
"Come on! It'll be fine! Why not? We can both get out of this reality, and live meaningful lives in a different one!"
"I... I guess"
You follow him over to the tents.
"Do you want to stay here?. There are always jobs for guards here."
"I can't. I'm sorry, but I just can't. I need to get back to the ship."
"Do you have enough?"
"Yes, I have more than enough."
"Well then, I'll see you around, Jacob. Live a meaningful life, okay?"
You enter your tent, leaving behind a confused O'Neill.
You make your way back to the ship as quickly as possible. You make haste inside, eager to get away from reality. You lay back in your bed, staring at the roof of your tent, slowly drifting off to sleep.
You awaken an unspecified time after, yet the ship is still parked in the exact same place. You get up, and begin to make your way out, when you remember that you left your gun behind.
You enter the tent again, and rummage around. Eventually your hands touch cold steel, as you grab your gun. You check it, and reload it, making sure it's ready for use. You grab a few other items you'll need, and head back outside.
You begin to walk, as you notice that O'Neill is nowhere to be found. You assume he's on his way back, so stay put. Two guards are on duty, and they acknowledge you. "Is everything alright?" the first guard asks. "Where's O'Neill? "You don't know. I left him in the ship, but he's not there anymore." The second guard laughs. "Oh yeah, I think he took off with some of our food."

"What?" you ask, raising an eyebrow.
"He's been stealing our rations for a week now. Stealing from both tents. The boss can't find him."
"How long have you known?
"About a week, I guess. He was nice and polite about it at first, but then I caught him and he ran off. Never seen him again."
You nod, and continue walking. You arrive at the camp, where the guards stop you from entering.
"Sorry sir, but we've orders to keep anyone out that doesn't work here. Have a nice day. "
"But I do work here!" you reply, slightly upset.
"Sorry sir, but I don't think the captain can do anything about it. I would like to shoot the little thief myself, but I'm sure he has a mother who needs him. Have a nice day, sir. "
"Fucking thieving scum. He'll pay for this." You mutter, and walk back out.
You keep walking, arriving at the gate about an hour later. You walk up to the guard, and he smiles. "Hello sir! How can I help you today?"
"I'm here to see the captain. Are you expecting him?"
"Yes, sir. He's in his office. Would you like to go inside?"
"Yes, please. "
You walk into the office, and see a large man sitting at his desk. "Hello. I'm Captain Pollo. Please sit down." He says, motioning towards the chair across from him.
You sit down, and the captain looks at you. "How may I help you sir? You don't look like an Emp-"
"I'm not. I'm a member of the shadows."
The captain's eyes widen, as he stands up. He grabs his sword, and points it at you. "You're the Shadows! You're responsible for killing my men! assaulting my camp! ." He says, as you pull out your gun. "Shadows, let's take him out!"
You don't respond, instead aiming at the man.
"WAIT! I-I'm sorry! I thought you were part of the rebellion!"
"What are you on about? What's all this about the shadows?"
The captain sits back down, sighing. "The shadows. They think that we're siding with the rebellion. They think that we're rebels."
"We are. "
"No, we aren't. This camp is neutral. We're siding with neither side. The republic will fall soon, and after it the shadows will perish. That's the will of the gods. That's why we need to wait here, and prepare. "
"I don't know if you're aware, but you're only one of two camps in this area. The other one is a few miles from here, and they're rebels. We're currently siding with them. "
"Rebels? The word I'd use is 'freedom fighters'."
"Whatever. The point is, we're on good terms with them. We help them in refugee rescue work, and they provide us with intelligence on the rebellion. That's why we're here."
