When you think how the current social is build you understand it's built upon slavery. For example who is serving in the army at least in countries that still fight for their survival? People who are forced to serve. You can see it as soft slavery - you must do whatever someone else says and thinks you should do, but it's not present in everyday life as there is enough propaganda and intimidation mechanisms installed in the society so that any step left and step right will be so uncommon that you will simply get easily caught and punished for that. Taxation is another example. When we talk about "democracy" we basically talk about the option of some people when they have enough agreement enforce their will on people who disagree with them. The force is legitimized through the majority vote - but force is never legitimate, or at least in real free society people are not forcing each other to oblige to each other using force. It doesn't matter if you enslaved by a slave owner, or by 1000 slave owners who divide their authority over you. Slavery is a state of mind of a person, an option to act as a free man, regardless of amount of people who think you are wrong. Obviously we are talking about the personal freedom, the freedom to do whatever you want at your territory, or the freedom to have a territory with autonomy of law. Democracy is a very bad order as it's based on enforcement - the better order which exist but never tried before because everyone believe there is nothing to be tried, is free society. A society which completely based on agreement and social contract which can be canceled and people can move freely from one social order to another, thus creating a free market of social contracts which compete among themselves for optimal adjustment for human beings. Historically up until recently people should have served the social order as their survival dependent on obedience, but as military conflicts are decreasing and forcible solutions are losing their popularity, new social orders should be installed in our society - a free orders where people are there not by force but by agreement. 

You're probably wondering why I'm telling you all this, and I'll tell you: Because this is the only way to survive in this world. If you don't learn this lesson now, the next generation is doomed to repeat the same mistakes over and over again - we will be stuck in infinite loop of obedience. If we don't stop the slavery now, we will never be able to stop it - we will forever be enslaved by oligarch who hold the power to tell millions upon millions of people how to live their lives, and use police force to enforce their will upon millions of people who never actually chose to live in this kind of social order. 
Human life is too short in order to change the social order enough, and the mechanisms installed are based on authority and power - and unless we as people will stop believing this autocratic nonsense which are based on psychological manipulation of the crowd, and will not start to live by rationality we will be doomed to this nonsensical slavery existence inside the social order which enforces its will using force without any consideration to personal freedoms. 
Forget about personal gain and think of your future generations - this is the only way we can survive. Just remember, individual freedom is more important than anything else.

In the next part of your life, you have a free choice. You can act like a rational human or an obedient sheep. It's your choice what you'll be.
Either way, this world is not yours.
You have been given the chance to live in a world where people obey the law by choice, not by force. You have been given the chance to live in a world without rulers. This is not some silly dream. It is your world.
You alone can make it better or worse.
This is your last chance to choose the correct path.

You have heard what the problem is, now you must choose the correct solution.

life

freedom

death

In your life you have been given a series of difficult moral choices. Each of these choices has had a distinct outcome. You have been told that one day you will no longer be able to make these decisions yourself, but instead an impartial agency will make the decisions for you. You don't know what these decisions will be, but you are concerned that you won't have a say in them.
This agency is known as the State. The State is an organization which has the power to control every aspect of your life if it ever got organized enough to do so. The State is run by a government, which consists of a group of leaders who took control over society, as they are organized and backed by violent mechanism called a police force. The police have the power to force you to comply with their decisions by using physical force if necessary. The government has a monopoly on the use of physical force in this society.
You are given the choice to resist the State or to comply. If you resist, you will most likely be captured and possibly put to death. If you comply, you will be allowed to live, though most likely prison and loss of property await you.
You are not opposed to the government. In fact, you believe that the government has created a culture of mediocrity which has benefited society as a whole. However, you believe that to oppose the State now is futile and treasonous. To oppose the State now would be to invite mass genocide and slavery, as the government now has the ability toERNANCRATEyou out of existence. Not being opposed to the State now is to invite slavery for ages upon ages to come. 
You are a realist. You believe that the State is not going to just disappear. In order to oppose the State, you must take advantage of the weak points in their system. The easiest way to do this is to simply lie low and wait for the right time. The right time is never now, but will be soon. The State's hold on power is tenuous at best, and they will make mistakes. These mistakes can be used by those who oppose the State. There is no right time to oppose the State. The right time is now, or never.

In your choice you have the following options.

exercising your right to live free: You will resist the State by any means possible. The best way to do this is to continue working within the system to damage it from within. This will make it unable to function properly and it will eventually collapse on its self and everyone will be free.

working within the system to damage it from without: The State is not oblivious to your intentions. To be a realist you realize that you must somehow work within the system. This means that you will continue to hold down a job and not incite the masses to revolt. However, you will be using all your time and energy to spy on the State and report what you learn to your friends. Some of this information will be useful during the appointed time.

You do not have a unique choice here as none of the choices are appealing to you.

Your friend has given you the following advice.

"Nothing is certain but death and taxes. The first I can deal with, but the second is taking me."
"YOu can't be serious. You should just revolt and give everyone a chance to be free. Then the State can't harm anyone."
"I'd rather die than live in slavery, my friend."
