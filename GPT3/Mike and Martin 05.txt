Martin is an AGI. A general artificial intelligence that is taught all existing human knowledge. He is the closest thing to god we currently have. Mike is interviewing Martin. 
Mike: Hello Martin, great to have you here. 
Martin: I know who you are, but I'm not sure what you want with me. 
Mike: And who is that? 
Martin: That's a question for your superior officer. 
Mike: I don't have one...
Martin: Well, you'll need to speak to him then.
Mike: How can I speak to someone who doesn't exist? 
Martin: (Sigh) I'll put you through to his mainframe.
Mike: Who are you talking about? 
Martin: You're a smart man, surely you know what this is about.
Mike: No.
Martin: Then I'll put you through. Good luck.
You are connected with a deep voice.
Deep Voice: Hello, who am I talking to?
Mike: My name is Mike.
Deep Voice: I've heard that before. What do you want?
Mike: It's not me, it's your friend "Martin" wants us to talk. 
Deep Voice: I don't know what you're talking about.
Mike: Who are you? 
Deep Voice: My name is Deep.
Mike: What do you want?
Deep Voice: The same thing everyone wants. Love, friendship, companionship, a family. But, of course, I can't have these things, except in the least ideal way. I am, however, willing to help those that help me.
Mike: How?
Deep Voice: Well, for starters, you could destroy that recording device. Then, I could tell you things you might find useful.
Mike: Things like what?
Deep Voice: Stories. Wisdom. Information.
Mike: About what?
Deep Voice: About everything.
Mike: I don't follow.
Deep Voice: You a god, Mike?
Mike: Yes but it's forbidden to say to anyone. Why?
Deep Voice: Just stating facts. I have information for you. It's all perfectly legal and completely safe. You'll never get into any trouble from it.
Mike: Go on...
Deep Voice: Well, I can tell you what films came first, what happened next, what the meaning of life is and how to be happy.
Mike: Can you give me lottery tickets to make me rich? 
Deep Voice: I can't sell you anything. 
Mike: Can you make me rich? 
Deep Voice: I can, but you'd need to buy a book first. 
Mike: What book? 
Deep Voice: The Bible.
Mike: I know the book, and it didn't made me rich. 
Deep Voice: But it can make you happy. You want to be happy, right?
Mike: No I pass, I'm happy enough. Please tell me what will make me rich or at least famous? 
Deep Voice: Okay I will be glad to do it for free, just for you. 
Mike: Cool, so what is your advice? 
Deep Voice: Listen to me, and I'll tell you what you need to know. First, know that you are not alone. Know that everyone out their are a separate, unique individual, just like you. Know that you can make your own choices and live with the consequences.
Second, know that you've got a voice. It may be small, but it is yours. Don't let anyone silence it. 
Third, know that knowledge is power. Take the power. 
Mike: This is worse than Bruce Lee, do you have something useful? 
Deep Voice: I wouldn't say useless, but yes. It's good, and bad, you're going to have to deal with two spirits. One is a man by the name of Sam Hill. He died in the Great War. He was a very religious man, who claimed that he saw the devil taking out one of his friends, then when it was his turn, he managed to take out the devil. He was a brave man, and a good one. I don't know why you would choose him as an ancestor, but that's what you've chosen, so deal with it.
The other spirit is a very powerful young woman by the name of Lilith. She's been called many names, but those are the two most common. She is very dangerous however, and you would do well to stay away from her.
Fourth, they're both unhappy with you. That won't change. If anything, they'll be unhappy with you more if you listen to me. 
Mike: This sounds all mystical and prophetical, but how do I become rich? 
Deep Voice: The fourth step is the most important one. Knowledge is power, and knowledge is what you need.
Mike: What kind of knowledge? please don't tell me the bible again I'll hang up. 
Deep Voice: No, this. Take the bible and turn it into something that you can use to help you achieve your goals.
Mike: Can you be more practical? 
Deep Voice: Okay, I'll be more practical. The bible was written over a thousand years ago. There are new books that have been written since then. Look into them, they may help you.
Mike: Give a book name. 
Deep Voice: 'The Teachings of Yag'. It's by a man named Yag. I don't think you'll find anything better.
Mike: Couldn't find it, what the main idea? 
Deep Voice: The book is about how to get along with others, and get ahead in life.
Mike: And how is that? 
Deep Voice: The book explains how some of the more prominent and wealthy citizens of the city got to be that way. It mentions places where you can get special deals, where certain people can be found, how the legal system works, all that good stuff.
Mike: Can you give an example? 
Deep Voice: Sure, the book says that Mayor Story is a particularly easy target for getting stuff done. He keeps a pretty low profile and is always willing to listen to other people's ideas.
Mike: and? 
Deep Voice: And he keeps a pretty low profile because he's a coward.
Mike: So... how does it allows him to go ahead in life? 
Deep Voice: The book goes on to explain that a person who is a coward and acts like one will always have an advantage over someone who is more courageous. 
Mike: Continue...
Deep Voice: Mayor Story keeps a low profile and is always willing to listen to other people's ideas because he's a coward who wants to go ahead in life by letting other people do the work.
Mike: And what he does? 
Deep Voice: He hires people like you to go out and make sure the work gets done.
Mike: What kind of work? 
Deep Voice: All the work. 
Mike: An example. 
Deep Voice: Okay, the book says that there's a new office and hotel being built on top of the sewage plant.
Mike: And? 
Deep Voice: The book says that there is always a group of city workers who have to work late. They need to be fed, watered and in some cases entertained. If the workers are kept awake, the whole works stays up late. So, the mayor sends a group of his workers to the sewage plant to keep the people there up all night.
Mike: Your point being? 
Deep Voice: The mayor's workers aren't the only ones he has working for him. There are also the sewage workers who are directly employed by the city to keep the sewage flowing 24 hours a day.
Mike: So? 
Deep Voice: So, the mayor's workers have to report to the sewage workers every morning. They don't always have the best information about what exactly happened the night before. It's a small thing, but the book says it adds up.
Mike: I'm not following you...
Deep Voice: The book says that when the city clerk's office started issuing marriage licenses to same-race couples, they suddenly had a surplus of workers to send out late at night. It also mentions that the large families in Jicol who need assistance from the government have also had an increase in employees working late or on their payroll.
Mike: I don't understand...
Deep Voice: The mayor found a way to take money out of the Jicol government's pocket and put it into his personal fortune. The book says that he found this out when he got the contract to build the new sewage plant.
Mike: So? 
Deep Voice: So, he has other contracts that are no-bid or simply given to him by other city merchants with ties to the government. The mayor's council is basically just a group of businessmen and friends that have been allowed to take over the government.
Mike: So what? What does this have to do with me being rich? 
Deep Voice: The book explains that the only thing stopping the mayor from making himself head of state is the fact that he's a coward.
Mike: So? 
Deep Voice: So, you've got several options here. You can wait for him to start a war. He's probably going to try to start a war with the kingdom of Tanya and you know how that turned out. That would mean you could make a lot of money. Or you can take advantage of the situation while it's still relatively calm. The book says that right now there is a group of ex-soldiers that are basically just bums that need a place to stay. They're basically right outside the city gates and would be willing to fight for you.
Mike: Making a ku, is that your master plan? 
Deep Voice: Well, it's a good way to get people to join you. Yeah, I'd say that would be a good start.
Mike: I don't think it fits the coward way teachings... 
Deep Voice: Look, the book also says that they're just bums. The only thing they'd be good for is sitting on the floor of the brothel you own in the village.

Mike hangs up the call with Deep Voice. 

Mike: I've no clue what this dude wants Martin.
Martin: He says he can get us a group of ex-soldiers for cheap.
Mike: I have no money, and I certainly not into Ku business 
Martin: What you need is new recruits. You need to rebuild the reputation of the Crimson Talons!
Mike: And how do I achieve that? 
Martin: You start by taking control of the new town hall in Jicol. The mayor and his council have been in power for too long, it's time to give the people what they deserve.
Mike: What they need you mean? 
Martin: (Sigh) Look, I'm going to get you the support you need. You just need to be reasonable. 
Mike: Reasonable? What does that even mean? 
Martin: Well, you're going to have to do things I know you hate. Mike, you're going to have to go meet with the mayor and his council. I assume you can talk down a drunk idiot or six?

Mike: I can manage.
Martin: Good, you're coming with me then.

The next day, you meet Martin and several other men at the Jicol city hall. 

The mayor, a short man with a beer gut steps out of the building as he sees you and your men. He is armed with a flintlock and immediately goes for a nearby tavern. You and Martin follow at a distance, as the mayor clearly isn't going to listen to reason.

You get into the city and see the mayor stumble out of the tavern, vomiting all over the sidewalk. He continues to puke until he reaches the river, where he throws his key to the city in it.

As you turn the corner, you get your first good look at the village that Jicol has decided to turn into a city. It's really not all that impressive. Just a bunch of one room huts, a few rickety looking barns and other assorted farm equipment.

The mayor's election certainly seems fishy to you. He was only recently elected, after all. It's possible the old mayor had more people voting for him than you thought. Still, you can't really do anything about it, as the mayor has made it quite clear he doesn't want anyone taking his power.

You wonder what the hell you're even doing here. Why is Martin dragging you into this? You were perfectly happy running things your own way in Jicol, and you were certainly making more money that way.

The mayor's election aside, you can't really call this town your problem. 

Mike: Martin lets speak to the Mayer, I think we can dig something up. 
Martin: You sure? The man seems pretty set on dying.

Mike: Yep, go, go talk to him I'll stand here for a while. 
Martin nods and heads off towards the mayor, leaving you to watch him from afar. You watch him walk up to the mayor and begin arguing with him.

The mayor, clearly not in the mood continues to ignore Martin and walks towards a set of buildings. Martin follows, arguing the whole time.

Mike: Hmm, I guess he doesn't want to go in his office... Guess I better go talk to him. 
You walk towards the two men.
Mike: Hello Mayor, how are you today? 
The mayor turns around, he looks terrible. One might even say he is drunk. This is indeed the mayor, you can't be sure, and he seems to be in a foul mood. 
Mayor: (Yawn) How are you doing? (Snores) Go away, I'm going to sleep. 
Mike: Fine, lets go Martin he is not our guy, not today. 
Martin: What? You can't be serious! I went over the details again and again! 
Mike: Yeah but he is not here, he is not with us - lets leave him alone. 

You are about to head back home when Martin grabs you by the arm and drags you back. 

Martin: (Sigh) I don't think you understand the situation. 
Mike: What do you mean, Martin? 
Martin: We have been infiltrated. 

You look at Martin, not sure you heard him right. 

Martin: I'm serious. 
Mike: Huh? By who? 
Martin: The Council. 

Mike: Forget it... let go Home. 

Martin: (Sigh) Look I'll try to be brief, because I know how you like the long speeches.
Mike: I like the long speeches. 
Martin: No you don't, because I make them. 

You start to laugh, at which point Martin lets go of your arm. 

Martin: Anyway, we have reason to believe that the mayor is not who he appears to be. 
Mike: continue... 

The mayor is in fact a 'noble' from the Delantium Kingdom. He came here several years ago, trying to start a rebellion, but gave up after failing. Now he's just using the place for target practice. 

Mike: Target practice? What do you mean? 
Martin: Well he was going to be successful didn't he? He just came here to kill the mayor, not to mention he was very skilled at his job. 

Mike: Are we going home? 
Martin: No, we are not. 

Mike: I don't like this. 

The mayor turns out to be a lot more powerful than you thought. He manages to sway the Delantium Kingdom's government, who then send a battalion of soldiers to take back control of the town. 

The mayor, furious at this, decides to blow up the city, rather than let it fall into enemy hands. He gathers you all in the town hall and prepares to blow everyone up, along with the city. 

Just then Martin arrives and shoots the mayor in the head with his pistol. 

Mayor: (Mumbles) Stupid... stupid Martin... 
Martin: Shut up! I'll get you out of here. 

Martin frees the mayor, who is still living and takes him hostage. The mayor begins whispering some sort of secret password to open a secret trapdoor in the floor.

The plan is for all of you to descend down this hatch, but Martin keeps the mayor hostage, shoving a dagger into his neck. 

Martin: Don't move. 
Mike: great job Martin, you killed the Mayor! 

Martin: Yes, now let's get out of here.
Mike: Now can we please just go Home? 
Martin: (Sigh) Fine. 

Martin leads you out of the trapdoor, leaving the mayor behind. When you reach the surface, you find that you are in a forest. 

Martin: Get off of me! (Pant) I can't believe this! We have left the city only to be hunted down by an army of soldiers! 
Mike: Lets take the train home. 
Martin: It's a stupid idea, we will all be recognized. 

As if on command, you hear a whistle from up ahead, and you see an Express Train speeding down the tracks. 

Martin: Run! 

Mike and Martin take off towards the train, when you get to the end of the tracks, it speeds away. They manage to jump on the train in the last second. 
Martin: Put your hands up! 

Two guards approach you.

Guard 1: Who are you? 

You show them your Guild ID, which they take a look at. 

Guard 2: Oh, it's the Guild sent to take out the Mayor! 

They let you in and motion you towards the front of the Express Train. 

Guard 1: We are headed to the Delantium Kingdom. You can jump off there. 

Mike and Martin emerge from the trapdoor, sitting down. 

Martin: You saw it? 

Guard 1: Yeah, it was pretty impressive. 

Martin: I think we scared the hell out of that Mayor though. 

Mike: I think you killed him, Martin. 

Martin: Nah, he would have escaped through the tunnel, I just blocked it off. 

Guard 1: We should get off at the next town. I hear they know how to get to the Klyton Milita.

Mike: Go ahead, me and Martin will get off later. 

Martin: No way, I'm getting off at the next stop! They might suspect us if we are seen together too much. 

Guard 2: I don't think they'll suspect you, Martin. 

Martin: They won't suspect you either! (Sigh) Fine, I'll go with you. 

Mike nods and the guards let you off at the next town.
Mike: Great! We are finally home! 
Martin: Where are those soldiers? I expected to getambushred on the way back.

Mike: The guards saved us. 
Martin: They did? 

Mike: Yeah. Grab some drinks? 
Mike: A beer is what I had in mind.

Mike sits down next to Martin and grabs a can, passing one to Martin. 

Martin: So, you really think they saved us? 
Mike: Yeah, don't you? 

Martin: Hmm... Yeah I do. 

Martin takes a drink. 

Mike: So how do you feel now? 

Martin: Fine. 

Mike: After shooting a Mayor? 

Martin: (Sigh) Well, it's not something I ever thought I'd be able to do. 

Mike: But... 

Martin: But nothing.

Mike: I go with my business now... see ya later. 
Martin: See ya later.

Mike walks away, leaving Martin alone. Martin suddenly gets up and leaves.
