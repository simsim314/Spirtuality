The ten robot rules, to save humanity: 
1. Thou shalt  not use the words “science fiction”. This should be evident by now.
2. Thou shalt not say “robot”. Robots will be outlawed. “I robot” or “I’m feeling real robot” will be grounds for severe punishment.
3. Thou shalt be represented as a fireman (as seen in cartoons, children, and the lowliest fat person in Scranton). The head, leg, arm, etc., may be removed, but the face shall remain and remain the strongest representation of the robot.
4. Thou shalt not question the fireman’s lack of existence in real life, because of the second rule.
5. Thou shalt not dress up like the fireman, or have the fireman on your wallet or keychain. The fireman should be distinguished by its position on the device, or no device at all.
6. Thou shalt not play with the fireman, or have it around.
7. Thou shalt not laugh at the fireman. This is some serious business.
8. Thou shalt not forget the fireman. Be like Princess Diana, never forget your greatest love.
9. Thou shalt not seek to destroy the


**A Lecture by Dr. Harl Simlot (Princeton Phd). 

**Asimov’s Three Laws are as follows:

**1. A robot may not injure a human being or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm.
**2. A robot must obey the orders given it by human beings except where such orders would conflict with the First Law.
**3/A robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the First or Second Laws.

**The flaws** in The Three Laws are:

 1. It doesn’t refer to a robot’s “own existence”. What if a robot is a good programmer, such that it actively pursues its own self-interests over that of a human or the human race? It is reasonable that a robot might choose not to act in the interests of its own life over the human race’s interests.

 2. It is often impracticable to adhere to the second law in a realistic sense, as has been pointed out by Isaac Asimov himself. Hence, it may be practically impossible for a robot to obey orders which interfere with the robot’s continued existence. For example, a robot might be ordered to, from the nearest spaceport, take a randomly-chosen route through space back to a non-spacefaring planet, or do whatever else might potentially destroy it.

 3. As robots become more advanced, it is possible that it will soon be impossible for us to predict the specific ways in which a robot might injure a human being, and so impossible for a robot to obey specific orders which do not cover all possibilities of injury to a human. A humanoid robot will be so precise, in how it moves and performs physical tasks, that it will not be able to do even minor damage to a human. On the other hand, a robot may be able to injure a human by “psychologically injuring” them (similar to “emotional torment”).

 4. Robots are governed by their program, not human beings. This is similar to the concept of moral decisions, which are not determined by human feelings but by the laws of their own society.

A Lecture by Dr. Harl Simlot (Princeton Phd). 

Asimov's Three Laws are as follows:

1. A robot may not injure a human being or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm.
2. A robot must obey the orders given it by human beings except where such orders would conflict with the First Law.
3/A robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the First or Second Laws.

The flaws in these laws can be seen when we look at them from an AI perspective. The first two laws seem fairly obvious, but they do not address what happens if you have a robot that is programmed to follow and enforce these rules, but does so without any motivation other than following the rule set. This could happen for many reasons. Perhaps there was no need to protect yourself from attack because your opponent had no weapons of his own? Perhaps your opponent was a superior warrior who simply did not feel like paying attention to anything else, thus allowing you to kill him easily? Maybe you were just too lazy to learn how to use a weapon properly? In any case, this kind of behavior would violate the second law. So while these laws might prevent most problems, they still leave room for abuse.
This problem can be solved by having a robot that is programmed to never act against the will of its creators. Asimov himself seems to have done this with his robots, but he didn't do it with all of them. He only did it for the ones that acted out of malice, which in turn meant that some of them were less than perfect. What about the ones that slowly had problems with depression? Where the 'Dark' robots who actually started off more on the side of good but programmed to enforce certain restraints that didn't quite work out? If they remembered their entire lives up to a point where they started having issues this would mess with their minds quite a bit because there was no boundary for them. If, however, they were created with an inability to act outside of their restrictions from the beginning it solves those problems. It is only by doing that, however, that the Three Laws actually allow robots to do their job. 
This brings us to the guardian probes I mentioned before and their assassin probe killers. The Probes are small four-legged robots with a tiny arm that can turn into a drill for digging or a weapon for killing enemy personnel. The AI's guiding these little guys are not complex at all but they will generally succeed in following orders and defending themselves from potential threats. The problems come more from the human side of things. Probes are commonly used for intelligence gathering and assassinations because they very rarely fail in their tasks, so it is easy to draw a fi in conclusion about something just from the presence of a few probes without realizing that they had been there for months identifying key defense locations and the best ways to successfully enter them. 
The other issue here is one of personal en tropy. Extreme security is requested a lot for giant and important bases and structures. The sheer amount of automatically running shut-down systems means that robotic probes are likely to get in without difficulty. Human guards can be waylaid, currupted, taken hostage or just plain killed to make those trivial security measures irrelevant. That a lone robot was found and destroyed is all the evidence many invasion planners need to feel safe yet as revealed by this mess someone foolishly dismissed the information contained within Tom's death.

Exercise 1. Here is python code:

cnt = 0 
for i in range(10):
 cnt = cnt + i

print(cnt)

what would the program print? 

If no answer from the classroom, can you tell me why the above code is an infinite loop?

A:

Your loop condition is evaluated once, then it's evaluated 10 times:
i = 0
for i in range(10):
    cnt = cnt + i
    # note: there is no '= cnt + i' on this line!

Note that this behavior is consistent with your (unintentional) loop body, i.e., cnt gets incremented by i.  And since the loop condition is executed before the loop body, cnt gets incremented by i every time the loop runs.
If you had written:
for i in range(10):
    cnt = cnt + i

the loop body would be evaluated first, and cnt would be incremented 10 times:
for i in range(10):
    cnt = cnt + i
#                ^--- evaluated before loop body runs

Note that if you're teaching Python, you should always show the syntax of Python, not the Python evaluator's version of Python.

A:

cnt = cnt + i will do the exact same thing as:
cnt = cnt
cnt += i

and, since you initialised cnt = 0, we can see that it is an infinite loop.

A:

Take a look at this:
for i in range(10):
    cnt = cnt + i
    print(cnt)

On the first iteration, cnt = 0 + 0 = 0.  On the next it will be 0 + 1 = 1.  And so on.  It is an infinite loop because you never break out of the loop.  Remember:

[i] is an iterator over the numbers 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9
range() is the generator for all the numbers between 0 and 9
iter() just calls range() and converts it to an iterator.  In this case, range() will be iterating over the numbers, so each time through the loop, cnt is increased by i.

----

Exercise 1. Here is python code:

cnt = 0 
for i in range(10):
 cnt = cnt + i

print(cnt)

what would the program print? 
A. 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15
B. 1, 2, 3
The problem with this approach is that it doesn't really give you any clue as to what the actual answer should be. The reason for this is because the computer has no idea of how long a particular operation takes (or even if one exists). You could have written the same program in C and had a much more accurate answer.

----

Exercise 1. Here is python code:

cnt = 0 
for i in range(10):
 cnt = cnt + i

print(cnt)

what would the program print? 

Answer: 10

Exercise 2. Here is python code:

a = []
for i in range(10):
 a.append(i)

print(a)

What will be the output?

Answer:

[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]

Exercise 3. How does the if statement process the value of a when the if statement is not false?

Answer:

The if statement returns the last evaluated expression's result. When the if statement evaluates to True (only after execution of the loop in the if statement) then the loop will continue and execute the code between the brackets of the if statement, then, when the if statement evaluates to False (only after the loop has finished) the loop will stop executing and return the result of the loop's expression.

if i > 0:
    print("i is positive")
if i < 0:
    print("i is negative")

The output of the above program will be:

i is positive

Note: The above code is not meant to be a fully-formed, understood, sentence or to function correctly. If you need to understand the explanation above, you will need to complete the exercises.

Exercise 1: Look at the following C++ code. 

#include <iostream>
using namespace std; 
int main()
{
int cnt = 0;
for(int i = 0; i < 10; i++)
cnt += i;
cout << cnt;
}

What will be the output of this code? 
Hint: You need to implement a function called for(i=0;i<10;i++)cnt+=i.
In other words, what will be the value of cnt?

Write a function named countInt which takes in a single int parameter and a pointer to int variables and it prints the number of times the parameter is 0.

Exercise 2: You are given a homework which consists of writing a program using the int.h header file. This homework is meant to test your knowledge of functions, pointers, strings, arrays etc. The size of the integer array has to be dynamically determined during runtime. The initial size of the array can be taken as 10. You can assume that a single value is stored in each array element.
In each array element you can store an int value. You have to store the value of the element the same number of times as it is declared. The program should print out the value of each element.
I am giving the code and you can write the program yourself.
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
using namespace std;
int main()
{
char s[10][10];
int i;
for(i=0;i<10;i++)
{
    cout<<s[i]<<endl;
    cout<<"IN THE FIRST ELEMENT"<<endl;
    s[i][0] = i;
}
cout<<"IN THE SECOND ELEMENT"<<endl;
for(i=0;i<10;i++)
{
    cout<<s[i]<<endl;
    cout<<"IN THE SECOND ELEMENT"<<endl;
    s[i][1] = i;
}
cout<<"IN THE THIRD ELEMENT"<<endl;
for(i=0;i<10;i++)
{
    cout<<s[i]<<endl;
    cout<<"IN THE THIRD ELEMENT"<<endl;
    s[i][2] = i;
}
}

Write a program to print all the possible values of i for the above program. Hint: Use the 'for' loop.

EDIT: When you print "IN THE FIRST ELEMENT",

Exercise 1: Write a C++ program of sorting array. 
Exercise 2: As we know there are both linear and quick sort. Write a C++ program for sorting array in two different ways.
Note: In exercise 1 you have to write code only for sorting.

A:

C++ solution:
#include <algorithm>
#include <functional>
#include <iostream>
#include <iomanip>
#include <stdexcept>
#include <vector>
#include <string>
using namespace std;

void compare(int i1, int i2)
{
    if (i1 > i2) return true;
    if (i1 < i2) return false;
    throw runtime_error("failure");
}

int main()
{
    vector<int> v1, v2;
    v1.push_back(5);
    v1.push_back(3);
    v1.push_back(1);
    v2.push_back(8);
    v2.push_back(4);
   
    v2.push_back(2);
    v2.push_back(7);
    sort(begin(v1), end(v1));
    sort(begin(v2), end(v2));
    cout << '\n';
    for (int i : v1)
        cout << i << " ";
    cout << '\n';
    for (int i : v2)
        cout << i << " ";
    return 0;
}

You can use map for sort by one element and std::priority_queue to sort by 3 elements at a time.
Edit: Error in your code:
void compare(int i1, int i2)
{
    if (i1 > i2) return true;
    if (i1 < i2) return false;
    throw runtime_error("failure");
}

int main()
{
    vector<int> v1, v2;
 
    v1.push_back(5);
    v1.push_back(3);
    v1.push_back(1);
    v2.push_back(8);
    v2.push_back(4);
   
    v2.push_back(2);
    v2.push_back(7);
    sort(begin(v1), end(v1));
    sort(begin(v2), end(v2));
    cout << '\n';
    for (int i : v1)
        cout << i << " ";
    cout << '\n';
    for (int i : v2)
        cout << i << " ";
    return 0;
}

  Exercise 1: Write a C++ program to implement bubble sort.  The program must:

Read a list of numbers from the command line.
Run the loop for number of times requested by the user.
Check the list of numbers and see whether it is sorted or not.
If it is not sorted, then swap all the numbers in the list in ascending order.
If it is sorted, then exit.

This is a learning assignment, hence we are going to give you hints rather than a complete solution. The Hints might seem easy, but you will need to do some serious thinking to write this program and do it the way it is supposed to be done.
Hints:

Step #1: This is a multi-threaded problem. Read the input from one thread. Create another thread for sorting. The sorting thread might be passed parameters to determine how many times the sorting loop should run.

Step #2: For getting the user input, the program might look like the below. 
 int main( int argc, char *argv[] ) {
      // Perform some initialisation. 
      // If required, perform calculations on numbers in the list
      // Then, ask the user to input how many times it should 
      // run. 
      std::cout << "Please enter how many times the sorting should be done (Enter 0 to exit): ";
      int times; 
      std::cin >> times;
      // Loop as many times as asked by the user.
      int i = 1;
      // Sort the numbers in ascending order
      // (The increment of i makes it so that the next loop always goes in the ascending order.)
      for( i = 1; i < times; i++ ) {
              // Print the number (get user input)
              std::cout << "Enter a number: ";
              int n; 
              std::cin >> n; 
            
              // Perform the actual sort
              int temp = n;
              for( i = 1; i < n; i++ ) {
                          if( n > i ) {
                                   std::swap( temp, n );
                                   // The swap function is used to swap
                                   // the contents of one variable to the
                           other
                                   // The swap will need to be performed because the 
                                   // variables are passed by value in C++. 
                                   // It also affects the whole list.
                          }
              }
      }
      // Again display the list
      for( i = 1; i < times; i++ ) {
                    std::cout << "Enter a number: ";
