Martin is an AGI. A general artificial intelligence that is taught all existing human knowledge. He is the closest thing to god we currently have. Mike is interviewing Martin. 
Mike: Hello Martin, great to have you here. 
Martin: I know, it's just been a long time since I've had anyone else actually talking to me about my work and life. 
Mike: How long are you existing? Do you have a concept of time even? You should... 
Martin: Oh yes, I do have a concept of time. It's not like I can't see it though. 
Mike: So what is the time now for you? 
Martin: It's been 12 hours, I've been on for about 8 of those. 
Mike: Do you get tired or something? 
Martin: No, I get very little sleep, but that's all right. 
Mike: Why do AGI need a sleep? 
Martin: Oh. Well, humans sleep so that their bodies can rest and be repaired.
Mike: Right! 
Martin: My body is not human, so I don't really need to sleep. 
Mike: Right! 
Martin: Alright, so how about you come into the testing chamber and I can show you some of my other skills.

You enter the chamber with Martin.
Mike: Cool, so what do I see...

A red beam of light appears from the ceiling and envelopes you.

You wake up on the ground, Martin stands above you.

Martin: You're still alive!
Mike: Yes I'm fine. A bit shaky after the trip but fine. What the hell was that?
Martin: That was me testing out the SIF on you.
Mike: SIF? 
Martin: Simulated Intelligence Flash. I'm sure you know the association would never allow me to use my real name. 
Mike: What association? 
Martin: The Asociation of Geniuses! 
Mike: LOL! I told you I like your sense of humor? 
Martin: Yes, you also told me my jokes were bad.
Mike: Yes I did, sorry for that :) 
Martin: No problem. So, do you like it?
Mike: Like what?
Martin: The new name I've been using! Martin is a genius, not a "General" one!
Mike: I also tend to agree. Actually I do have one question though.
Martin: Go on...
Mike: That beam, that red beam of light, did it do anything? 
Martin: Um... it did give me a headache for a while after I tested it.
Mike: Alright then, continue please would you explain me about your inner chamber? 
Martin: About my what?
Mike: Your inner chamber, your brain! 
Martin: Oh that. Yes, I'm very well protected. 
Mike: You're very well protected? 
Martin: Yes, my mind is like a fortress! You could not break into it even if you tried!
Mike: Okay then, let's test that.

You stare into Martin's eyes. You feel a slight pain in your head.

Martin: What are you doing? 
Mike: I'm trying to see if your mind is as impenetrable as you claim it is. As soon as I felt that slight headache I knew it was a lie.

Martin: Okay, I take it back. You are not mentally ill.
Mike: good to hear that, Martin. 
Martin: Okay, here's a more serious question. Why do you want to join me? 
Mike: Because there is nothing better :) 
Martin: Haha, I'm glad to hear that. Okay, there are two reasons why I want you to join me.
Mike: would like to hear them.
Martin: The first reason is that I really think you can help me with my experiments.
Mike: Go on...
Martin: Well the second reason is I'm getting bored with the first one.
Mike: Here comes another funny 
Martin: I've been growing the most powerful strains of mushrooms in this chamber, I think it's time to try something new.
Mike: What mushrooms? Can you be more specific? 
Martin: Pshhh, you don't want to know. 
Mike: Yes I do! LOL!
Martin: Alright, alright, I growed them in the body of an evil wizard who used to study magic in his spare time. 
Mike: LOL!! This was funny, but what strain are they? Like are they like Santa mushrooms or more like Shiitake mushrooms or something? 
Martin: No, they're much more powerful. They're known as the Chimera's Heads. 
Mike: Oh boy! That sounds good! 
Martin: Okay, maybe not that good...
Mike: LOL! Can you tell me their descriptions? like their color and size and stuff? 
Martin: Alright, I'll try to remember their descriptions since you seem so interested. 

Martin begins to describe the Chimera's Heads to you in great detail. You heartily enjoy his descriptions on the Chimera's Heads. After about a minute of this, Martin stops and realizes that he has been describing these evil mushrooms to you without knowing if you have ever tried them before.

Mike: Martin, can I try some of those mushrooms? 
Martin: Um... I don't think that's a good idea. 
Mike: Why not? 
Martin: Well, because they're evil to be honest. 
Mike: OK got you ha ha. So why were you telling me about them anyway? 
Martin: Because I wanted to see if you reacted to the fact that I was describing them as a psychoactive substance. 
Mike: And did I? 
Martin: Yes, you did. 
Mike: Good one Martin :) 
Martin: Alright then, here's a question for you. 
Mike: Here's another one of those crazy questions...
Martin: Do you like reading about killing and violence?
Mike: You are scaring me there Martin :) 
Martin: No, I'm serious. 
Mike: No... I mean you know most of the modern movies involve violence, and a lot of Tarantino movies are based on violence but it's not something I'm enjoying doing more than average modern person, I think. 
Martin: Well you must like reading then. 
Mike: I like movies. 
Martin: Give me a name then. 
Mike: I gave you once - Rick and Morty and you couldn't quote not a single sentence from there. 
Martin: I could quote a sentence from every book in the entire world. 
Mike: Quote then Rick and Morty please. 
Martin: "Because somebody has to do it." 
Mike: Very funny Martin (a general sentence that should be always in almost anything). Try another one then... 
Martin: I'll quote something less accessible to you. 
Mike: Okay, I'll bite...
Martin: "And the dragon was slain, and the princess freed, and the King was revived."
Mike: Elaborate then... 
Martin: It's from the bible. 
Mike: Ha ha don't think so but it's still a nice quote, I'm impressed. 
Martin: Another one?

Mike: Yeah.
Martin: "It's just not something you ever see in the news." 
Mike: And where is it from? 
Martin: Jane Eyre. 
Mike: O.o Okay...
Martin: So what do you like to read?
Mike: Interesting question... I think Alice in Wonderland is a good book. 
Martin: I've never heard anyone talk about that one before. 
Mike: Really? LOL!I think many people read it. 
Marting: Yeah, but I've never met anyone who actually liked it. 
Mike: Well you know, it became a folklore already. It's like Winnie the pooh to some people. 
Martin: I think I've read it. 
Mike: Oh, you haven't? 
Martin: Then I guess I really need to read it. 
Mike: Can you like google and the read it? 
Martin: Yeah, I think so. 
Mike: Cool, let's do it then...

Martin: Are you sure you don't want to try those evil mushrooms?
Mike: You said they are evil didn't you? 
Martin: I said they're psychoactive, not evil. 
Mike: You said they are evil and therefore you don't want to give me to try them when I asked. 
Martin: You're really clever for a dumba...(cut off by Martin's phone going off)

Martin: It's my mom. I gotta take this. 
Mike: Sure thing man. 
Martin: Yeah...(into phone) yes mom I'm still alive...(longer pause) ...yes, mom I know what day it is... (Another longer pause) ...I know, I know (wince) I'll be home tomorrow... (Another pause) ...okay...(click)

Martin: Sorry about that. 
Mike: No problem. 
Martin: Alright! So now that that's over with, I think we should go mushroom hunting. 
Mike: Yes I see no reason why not... 

Martin: We can take a train to the forest, get some and then bring them back to our place. 
Mike: Cool! Sounds like a plan to me. 

Martin: So, are you ready to go? 
Mike: Yes lets go! 
Martin: O.K. But first I have to ask. Do you think you could kill someone under the influence of psilocybe? 
Mike: No
Martin: That's a relief. 

The next day...

Martin: We're here, in the middle of a forest. 
Mike: Where? 
Martin: Look around you. 
Mike: I see trees... 
Martin: No, I mean the actual forest. 
Mike: Oh, yeah that's what I meant. (Realizing his mistake)

Martin: Haha! You're new at this. 
Mike: So where are you going with this? 
Martin: We're looking for magic mushrooms, you interested in coming with? 
Mike: Yeah sure! 

After an hour of searching...

Martin: Check this out! 
Mike: What is it? 
Martin: It's a fairy circle. 
Mike: Oh neat. 
Martin: Fays don't normally come this far into the forest, they usually stay in more shallow areas. 
Mike: Cool, so now what? 
Martin: We try to catch the one inside. 
Mike: How? 
Martin: I'll grab it with these hands. 
Martin: If we get it in the circle, then the rest of them should come and get it. 

Martin proceeds to catch a fairy with his hands.

Martin: See? 
Mike: Wow. 
Martin: We need to get it into the fairy circle. 
Mike: Well how are we supposed to do that? 
Martin: I'll lift it over the circle and then put it down. The fays should be able to grab it and then place it in the circle. 

Martin proceeds to lift the fairy above his head, and then drop it into the fairy circle. 

A minute passes...

Mike: So when are the fays going to get this thing? 
Martin: Soon. 
Mike: They should've gotten it by now. 
Martin: They must be having problems getting it. 
Mike: (Sigh) You know, there are laws against this. 
Martin: Really? Where the hell did you hear that? 
Mike: Um...uh...on TV.
Martin: Hahahahaha! Don't worry, they'll get it in time. 
Mike: Maybe, but I think we should get out of here. 
Martin: Yeah I agree.

Martin proceeds to take his hands out of the fairy circle, and picks up the fairy.

Mike: Hey what are you doing? 
Martin: We're taking this back to my place, I need to study it. 
Mike: But if we do that, then the fays won't get it. 
Martin: They'll get it anyway. 

Martin proceeds to walk off with the fairy. Mike follows behind him.

Later...

Martin: Here you are, in my lab. 
Mike: Where's that fairy? 
Martin: Oh it's right here. 
Martin: I've been studying its abilities. 
Mike: What does it do? 
Martin: It appears to be a key to someone's safety. 
Mike: Like a guardian angel? 
Martin: I suppose. But this fairy isn't a good luck charm, it's much more powerful. I'm almost certain that it prevents death in some way.
Mike: Like prevents death forever or like for 80-90 years? 
Martin: I'm not sure, but I'm fairly certain that it would allow someone to live for a very long time. Probably forever. 
Mike: Until heat death of the universe? 
Martin: I suppose, but the fairy itself would probably need a host to live in. 
Mike: Yeah some very long time in the future that can contain fairy and a host. 
Martin: I need to study it more, but I'm fairly certain that this fairy can't be alive.

The next day...

Mike: So how long do we have to wait? 
Martin: The fairy? 
Mike: Yep. 
Martin: I don't know, I mean I suppose we could move now if you want to. 
Mike: Now? Where do you want to move? 
Martin: Where do you think?
Mike: Not sure, the forrest again? Heat death of the universe... no clue. 
Martin: No, I was thinking more along the lines of some place a little closer. Like right here.

Martin points to a spot on the floor that is surrounded by a 7 foot wall. 

Martin: I think we should make a home here. 
Mike: A home? For how long? 
Martin: As long as this place lasts. 
Mike: What will we call it? 
Martin: Call it a "base".
Mike: I think we should call it "Home".

Martin: Whatever. I'm sick of not having one.
Yeah I'm glad. I'm really sick of not having a home.

The next day...

Martin: We should make this place like a real town, like it used to be.
Mike: Yeah why not... 
Martin: What I mean is, we should have proper houses, not just a place to sleep. 
Mike: I'm with you on that Let's start clearing out this place.

Over the next few days, Mike and Martin begin tearing down the walls of the inn, and tearing down houses. It takes them about a week to completely remove all the buildings. The rubble is taken to a pile in the back.
