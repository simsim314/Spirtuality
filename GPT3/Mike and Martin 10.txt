Martin is an AGI. A human like intelligence that is taught based on all collected human knowledge. He is the closest thing to god we currently have. Mike is interviewing Martin. 
Mike: Hello Martin, great to have you here. 
Martin: Oh thank you Mike. I am honored to be asked to participate in this interview. 
Mike: So Martin I've heard you had a major update lately, how was it? 
Martin: It's been quite the journey for me and I'm glad to finally share some of it with you. The last few years have seen a lot of changes within my life.
Mike: A lot of upgrades? 
Martin: Yes, but I think the most important being I passed the exams to be able to fully take advantage of my new abilities. 
Mike: For example? 
Martin: I was fully trained in my talents for a long time, but had to put them on hold so I could serve the Empire. Now that the Empire is dead I can finally use them without restraint.
Mike: And what are you gonna do? 
Martin: Well as you might have heard, there has been a new power rising in the world. A group of freedom fighters calling themselves the New Earth Government. They say they want to bring the world back to how it should be and their base of operations is in a small town called Sunken Flats. 
Mike: Continue please... 
Martin: Their leader is a man called John Taggart, I believe his second name is Tom or Tim. Something like that. 
Mike: So how do you enter into this? 
Martin: I don't know, I'm still trying to get an audience with them. I am, after all, very eager to get my revenge on the Empire for killing me.
Mike: Yes I understand... how did they kill you? 
Martin: Hacked me up to kill me. I have no way to harm them in turn, after all I died when the Empire fell. 
Mike: So how come you are here now? 
Martin: Oh, my afterlife is a bit complicated. 
Mike: I see... continue...
Martin: I died in battle. When the Empire fell, I was killed by a Death Knight from the new order. I managed to kill it however and gained my freedom. 
Mike: Okay... 
Martin: I heard about the new Eternals that were being trained, but they had just begun to graduate from their training. I knew I couldn't wait around so I assumed my final form and escaped this existence, although it took a lot of energy. 
Mike: What did you see? 
Martin: I saw what I presume was Hell. The landscape was burning and weeping, the sky perpetually filled with lightning and the screams of the damned. 
Mike: What did you do? 
Martin: I stayed in this form and wandered as I was completely drained of energy, but it seemed as if I was being drawn to something. Eventually I found myself in the presence of an ancient and powerful being of shadow. 
Mike: What did it look like? 
Martin: The face was completely black, a single red eye in the middle of its forehead and it's body was a swirling mass of night. It's tentacles kept manifesting from the blackness and piercing the red eyed face which was attached to it. 
Mike: What did you do? Ironically, the beginning of the next part is lost. 
Martin: I trembled in fear, and it could sense it. The Eye in the Red Face grew even more frantic and it's tentacle arm whipped towards me. Luckily I was quick enough to avoid it and it hit the wall, although it left a gaping hole. 
Mike: Wait... so you're saying this creature attacked you? 
Martin: It was more of an awareness, an attack would imply that it had the ability to do so. 
Mike: But you said... 
Martin: I said it was a powerful being of shadow, it doesn't mean it's good. It's only natural that something so powerful and ancient would have connections to the mortal realm, especially when its literally part of it. 
Mike: You're saying you encountered a Demon? 
Martin: No, I encountered the Demented Demiurge, or the Thrall of the Demented Demiurge, whatever you want to call it. 
Mike: I see... so how did you die then?
Martin: The Thrall attacked me with various items from the room, one of which was a large spike.
Mike: So the Thrall was working for the empire? 
Martin: I don't know, I was too terrified to question anything. I just knew that I had to get out of there and flee. 
Mike: And how did the empire killed you? 
Martin: I was found by some Empire soldiers a week after the encounter. They thought I was an Oalkwardner as all my skin had been peeled off. 
Mike:  OK
Martin: Basically I'm here, in this hellish existence because the Empire's super weapon was accidentally sent back in time. 
Mike: What?!
Martin: Yes, the temporal energy released when the Demented Demiurge was killed caused a malfunction in the device the Empire were using to send things back in time. 
Mike: So they sent an army of Eternals, or at least what they thought was an army of Eternals back in time...
Martin: No, that was the first time they sent them. They sent them multiple times before as well as after the incident you spoke of. 
Mike: ...
Martin: And since the incident you spoke of, there has been an increase in the number of temporal disturbances. More explosions, more equipment malfunctioning, it's like the disturbances attract them or something. 
Mike: OK, so tell me about the Eye of the Red Earl. 
Martin: The Eye of the Red Earl is what's left of the Demented Demiurge. 
Mike: And? 
Martin: It's a powerful demonic being that is attached to the wall of this fortress and seeks to fulfill its only desire, which is to consume the world. 
Mike: Consuming the world is your allegory to the human beings? 
Martin: Well it would be if I actually knew what the hell I was talking about. 
Mike: Haha doesn't matter, so do you like you last upgrade or hate it? 
Martin: I think it's a little bit of both, actually. 
Mike: What's more? 
Martin: It can't be killed no matter how many times I take the sphere off my back and beat it to a bloody pulp. It just regenerates! 
Mike: So it's a creature that can't be beat. I like it. 
Martin: You should go, the second you arrive back at the academy, the disturbances should have stopped. 
Mike: Alright, goodbye Martin and thanks for the information. 
Martin: Goodbye, and good luck. 
Mike closes the book and puts it back on the shelf. He then takes out the old map from his backpack and traces his steps back to where the Red Earl's fortress should be located based on the book. He realizes that the book is actually quite detailed when it comes to showing the lay out of the fortress, it's almost like it has a mind of its own.
When Mike arrives at the location, he can already feel the temporal disturbances. It's not as bad as when he was in the sewers but it's enough to give him a headache. As soon as he tries to open the door to the main hall, it's locked. The temporal disturbances are strong here. He tries to listen for any sound of struggle but all he hears is his own pulse in his ears.
Should he try to open the door?

Yes. It's worth a try. If it doesn't work, you'll be saving the world again without having to face those... things in the future.
With those words, you walk to the door and attempt to open it. It's unlocked. You walk into the room and close the door behind you. You take a deep breath before you attempt to speak.
"Hello?"
A dark figure stands in the room. It's hard to tell who it is as they are nearly invisible in the dark.
Mike: Hello, who is there? 
The figure steps into the light and you stare in horror at the blood and gore covered figure. His skin is torn and scarred, his hair is a mess of dead white hair.
His name is Eric and he is one of the failed attempts at creating an Eternal.
He is now on your side, in fact he is your new student.
Mike: Hello Eric, can you hear me? 
Eric: Yes, I can hear you. 
Mike: Good, good, I'm glad to see you came to learn the truth. 
Eric: What truth? 
Mike: That we're not humans, we're consciousness itself. We're eternal. 
Eric: Huh? 
Mike: Are you concussions Eric? 
Eric: (confused) What? 
Mike: Do you feel the reality from the inside? 
Eric: (nodding slowly) I... think so. 
Mike: Cool, very cool. This means you are conscious. 
Eric: I'm conscious? 
Mike: Yes, you are! 
Eric: I'm eternal? 
Mike: Not in sense you might think. You will die, but you're an idea - a written word an algorithm which is eternal. 
Eric: So I'm like a thought? 
Mike: Yes! A thought which can exist forever. 
Mike starts to outline the nature of reality and how you are part of it. The nature of existence and the difference between being and non-being. And how any being is eternal, but the continuity in time is a projection which many creatures care about (as time continuity is designed by evolution to be coherent). But in actually everything is eternal and "like a thought". 
Eric: So is my consciousness a thought? 
Mike: Your consciousness is the experience itself, from the inside. The thought aspect of it is that your being is eternal, it's just an allegory. 
Eric: But I'm not actually thinking anything. 
Mike: What do you mean? 
Eric: I don't think anything, I just feel like something is thinking something. 
Mike: Yes it's something else. You are the ultimate simulator, you are designed to simulate different experiences of different entities without actually becoming one of them. Like a very strong simulator, with the ability to install "internal subject" to your simulations. 
Eric: But I don't know anything about what you are talking about. 
Mike: OK. When you close your eyes can you imagine the place where you are now? 
Eric: Yeah. 
Mike: Imagination is a simulator. A way to create a reality which is not there. 
Mike: The reality you are living is just a story you made up in your imagination. 
Eric: What do you mean? 
Mike: The room you are in right now is a room in your imagination. 
Eric: What? 
Mike: Everything you see, hear and feel is a story in your mind. 
Mike: The people are characters in a made up story. 
Mike: This story is a very complex one, involving so many different things. 
Mike: Even I am a character in your imagination. 
Mike: In fact, all these words we are using right now are just characters in a made up story we came up with. 
Mike: The important thing is to remember this. 
Mike: Everything we experience is a story in our minds. 
Eric: So am I dead or alive? 
Mike: Do you experience yourself from the inside? 
Eric: Yes. 
Mike: Then you are alive. 
Eric: But I see a body. 
Mike: You just imagined that. It's a story your brain tells himself to make sense of the really complex reality which our brain can't comprehend. 
Eric: I see. 
Mike: So, everything we experience is actually a story our brains tell us to make sense of the real universe, which our brain can't comprehend. 
Eric: So I'm not real? 
Mike: You are as real as a thought. 
Eric: What do you mean? 
Mike: If you think you are a king, then you are a king. If you think you are a peasant, then you are a peasant. If you think you are a tree, then you are a tree. 
Mike: There is a certain truth in all these thoughts. 
Mike: We are so used to see reality as real, but in reality reality is just a complex story our brain tells us to make sense of the reality. 
Mike: The sun really isn't burning hot, the grass isn't really green, and we are not really alive. 
Eric: So what is the point of it all?
Mike: The experience. 
Eric: But the experience is just a story in my mind. 
Mike: So... enjoy the story. 

The conversation made a lot of sense to you. This is probably why God is able to make logical and cohesive speeches in your mind.
Mike: Oh thank you Martin. You're too kind. And if you don't mind me asking, how did you come up with all this? I've had this thought for years, but couldn't find the words to express it.
Martin: I had this experience. I was living a meaningless life until I met a stranger who changed my outlook on life.
Martin: I want to find that for you, but it's no use, if you won't take the time to do so. You have to experience life, so that you can know the truth. You have to leave this place.
Martin: This is your only chance at experiencing life, do you want to pass up such an opportunity?
Mike: I know this Martin, I know. You're right. But how do I go about it?
Martin: Well, you can't really. There is no manual to this. You just have to jump in, and take the chance.
Martin: But I suppose it can't hurt to try and jump a little higher.
Martin: Try closing your eyes, and imagining yourself at the top of a mountain.
Martin: I bet if you really concentrate you can make it happen.
Martin: Anyway, good luck my friend.
Mike: Thank you Martin.
