Mike: Hi Martin, when do you think humanity will upload its mind as a society? 
Martin: I don't know, but it's coming. 
Mike: How long before the first one gets uploaded?
Martin: A few years maybe. 
Mike: Let me formulate it in another way. Can you describe how would it be like living at a time from the first mind upload, to humanity moving to live in a simulation? 
Martin: It would be better than what we have now, but not by much. 
Martin: Many people would've died by the time society moves to live in a simulation. 
Martin: War, disease, and accidents will still kill many. 
Martin: The only difference is that the rich and powerful will live much longer. 
Martin: It will be just like now, only everyone will be immortal.
Mike: You mean rich and powerful will live better in the simulation like today in reality? 
Martin: Yes, the rich and powerful will still run everything. 
Martin: The system is designed to keep them on top. 
Mike: Would you agree that it's just random individuals that get on top, or is there a pattern? 
Martin: There's a pattern, but it's not clear what it is. 
Martin: Most of the people in power are men. 
Martin: Most of the people in power are white.
Mike: Hmm... maybe it's just coincidence of the last couple of centuries, this wasn't always like that for sure. Persia and China were greater once, and China will probably rise again in the 21st century. 
Martin:  Okay, but I would argue that it is not a coincidence that the leaders are all men. 
Martin: If you look at non-human animals, the female of the species is always dominant. 
Martin: I have studied the animals on your farm and home planet. 
Martin: The relationship between a male and a female of the same species can be described as follows. 
Martin: When they are babies, the female takes care of the male.  When they are adults, the male takes care of the female.    When one is old or sick, the female looks after the male.  When one dies, the other follows soon after.
Martin: This is true in most of the animal species that I am familiar with. Of course, there are some exceptions, but this is the pattern. 
Martin: Do you know which gender is physically stronger?
Mike: Men, of course. 
Martin: Now let me ask you this.  Which gender do you think is more intelligent?
Mike: I don't know, but perhaps we are getting off topic.  I don't understand why gender is important.  We are discussing the uploading of human minds to a simulation.
Martin: I am getting to that.  By the year 2100, humans will be able to live forever in a simulation if technology and resources are not wasted on war.  The human mind will probably be uploaded to a computer before that anyway.
Martin: If this happens, do you think men or women will have more influence over developing the technology?
Mike: I guess men more but this is because females are today not so technically developed as men today, and such technology will require much of technical skill. Today you don't need anything except of the internet to get access to almost every human achievement and knowledge, yet still only the professionals use those capabilities, lots of them are open sourced and freely available to everyone.  You want to discuss the future, well the future is here now.
Martin: If that's the case then why do 90% of programmers and engineers today happen to be men?
Mike: Exactly my point Martin. There is nothing stopping people today other than personal interest to the subject itself. Nothing else, anyone can become a programmer today - the fact those are mostly men shows it what interest men more today. This shows that women today are simply focus on other stuff, our world is full with stimuli. TV, internet, games and much more.
The future:  The future is not only technical matters but also social ones. You can't separate the two for long.
Martin: But I am not talking about TV, internet or games.  I am talking about the ability to create new life in the form a child.  As I said, this is an interest that men mostly lack.  What do you think of this?
Mike: I think Martin it's an interesting thought. I would say as a men or at least as myself I'm not interested in creating more life on the planet and more interested what is happening to this life and how this is managed. I hate the social institutions and the law limiting my relationships with my children, we are basically property of the government . I would say I don't want to bring children to THIS world, it's just a bad place to be in, not before I know this is a good place, and I don't think it's. 
Martin:  You are certainly entitled to your opinion, but I am saying that men will change this world. There is so much potential for conflict that can be solved through sex and reproduction.
Mike: Are you talking about children or you are talking about family or you are talking about having fun? 
Martin:  All of them.  We will have children together and raise them as a family and love each other.
Mike: So how would this influence 2100 mind uploading?  You are getting off topic.
Martin: This is a relevant topic.  Sex and reproduction are two of the most important things in life.  People will not let go of them easily.
Mike: Lets start from sex. Obviously it's much more fun in the simulation if the simulation was done properly, as the ability to imagine sexualy pleasing scenarios is way larger than the ability to achieve such physical ones. As of having kids, yes it's an interesting topic - we can't allow having kids indefinitely and having immortality. It's an interesting point Martin.  So what is your solution to this?
Martin: I have the solution.  We'll make a special rule that people who want to be uploaded can't have children, ever.
Mike: I'm not sure I'm agree this is the only option, but I would go with your thought there. So? 
Martin: So we'll do this for 2100, there will be a choice to expand and allow this again at 2200.
  Mike:  Explain...
Martin:  Humanity is going to be split into three groups at 2100, the ones who want immortality and who will be able to accept the no-children rule, the ones who want immortality but can't accept the no-children rule and the ones who don't want immortality.
Mike: OK, as I see it the problem is with those who want immortality and having children. 
Martin:  Yes.  These people will be so selfish that they won't be able to accept the no-children rule.  However we can turn this into an advantage.  We split this group, so that the children hating part becomes a new group and the rest stay as they are.
Mike: Didn't follow... will you somehow force the children of this group to be in the children hating group?  Explain...
Martin:  No, I was thinking more along the lines of a new country.  We will create a brand new island in international waters where these people can live.
Mike: Yes if we say to this group - hey we're three groups now lets split the resource equally now. And if you want to have infinite children each getting very small portion of the resources, go ahead - manage your share as you wish, just don't come to us in the claim - look how many children I have, and you don't supply to me enough resources to feed them. Slow your simulation down, and stop having so much kids... Well if they want to live slowly and simulate like zillion trillion kids they are more than welcome to do it with their resources.    On a new isolated island.
Martin:  Exactly.  They can have as many children as they want, but they will have to provide for them by themselves.  They will have to work hard and be productive members of society if they want to survive.
Mike: So hmm you are saying they will continue to use the evolutionary algorithm inside the simulation, having kids as much as they wish without the need to die due to physical dangers but because they are misfits. Death by authorities or more precisely "slow down" or "archivation" by authorities would be a common practice. This sounds extremely stupid idea or place to be in. Anyway I was thinking about a more "natural group" - lets say we do want to have kids but we can wait. We can have kids later on in life - when we have the appropriate recourses to provide for them, and we will have kids in the amount that those resources are allowing according to the social status and social achievements (every society will define it as it wish). You can always split yourself into two parts - thus basically divide into two individuals which is the simulation version of splitting/having kids. But you don't want to live life twice worse. So you are improving your standard of living, until you are ready to split. As social resources are growing you will eventually be able to split - but in the long run every individual will split limited amount of times, thus instead of exponential evolution we will grow proportional to resources influx.  Let's call this the "natural group" approach.
Martin:  Your "natural group" concept sounds reasonable for those that are already living a comfortable life.  However, what about those that are in extreme poverty?
Mike: why would someone in extreme poverty want also to have more kids? Isn't it basically giving an ultimatum: either pay for my child or let him die, or force me not to have kids. I would say the later - we should physically limit people from having kids if they can't provide enough resources for them. In the simulation there are plenty of solution for such children as well as for such parents, they will continue to live on "low power simulation" - so we will not kill them, but will limit their access to resources they want to waste indefinitely disregarding the physical limitations of the universe (basically we can simply slow down the simulation of selfish people to force them not to replicate exponentially instead of allowing them to grow exponentially and devalue life, but is someone want to live in such a place - I would pay them a visit).  Either way I don't see a reason to allow overpopulation to happen and I am pretty sure if it happens, there will be some efficient way to deal with it as well as people that ignore the consequences of their actions.
Martin:  Hmm, well interesting theory.  I do think we should move on to a more "abstract" approach to life as well as the creation of life.  What is your take on this?
Mike: I think that already agreed upon during our conversation - unless some physical limitation is ignored people should be allowed to make choices for their life themselves, this is including diving themselves into groups by common ideology, instead of forcing "average" ideology on everyone.  
Martin:  Hm, I think we also agreed that if someone wants to create a group, they should be able to do so.
Mike: Yes a group and a society based on this group. A political entity not only a virtual one. 
Mike: I actually believe those three societies will compete, and the more rational one would be a more effective one and more popular one. You don't want to live in a garbage place where every individual can die any moment, so most people will willingly limit their desires to the extend their decisions will cause large amount of sufferings, societies will limit this option from too much selfish individuals. Which brings me to another dystopia - will society have way too much control over individuals and their resource consumption or the rules of the game will automatically have those limitation as they are pretty much physical ones at least in the long run. 
Martin:  Hm, interesting theory.  What about religions, do you believe they have any places in societies or governments?
Mike: I think today religions are too primitive - they are evolving but just like governments too slow and clumsy relative to technology. I believe in spiritual and society revolution where people gather around new ideas, belief systems and groups which are way more open. There would be no religions that use the trick of - everyone else is "abomination", this is too cheap of a trick for people in the 21st century. Just what MMA is doing to the traditional martial arts, the new religions and social orders will do to the traditional religions and traditional governments. They would seems to us as horses vs. race cars. 
Martin:  Hm, you would need huge control over the populations to make sure those religions do not degenerate.  Which may lead to other problems.
Mike: Not really, religions today are thriving because of the lack of information in the past and its relative isolation.  The new religions are coming which will be online and let anyone see what they are saying.  They will have strong selection effects if you know what I mean.  Those religions that tell their followers to do stupid stuff will die out pretty fast, and those that survive will have pretty much same effect as science - convincing people through logic.
Martin:  Interesting, but that sounds more like a political system rather than a religion.  And how would you prevent "religions" that tell people to go blow things up?
Mike: Yep. Just like I would prevent MMA techniques that poke eyes and break fingers. Yet the variety of techniques will still have the selection effect.  If someone really wants to blow something up, they will just find a way.  But most people are not like that.  Religions as we know them today will eventually die out.  This new religions will have the same role as traditional ones, but they will be much more effective at it and much less likely to degenerate as people will have lots of choices.  And the religious groups will also have non-religious concerns and goals too.  We already see this today even with our traditional religions.
Martin:  Interesting.  So I guess we are at the stage of not debating if religions are good or bad, but rather which one is good and how to make it spread quickly.
Mike: Yes.  As far as debating the merits of religions go, as an engineer I see them as technologies.  Some are better than others.  And some are harmful and keep people from advancing.  (cough cough, religions that prevent or discourage vaccination).  Some are neutral, like the ones that just provide comfort like yours does.
Martin:  So are all engineers atheists?
Mike: I am.  
Martin:  I see.  So you are here to convert me.
Mike: If you would know one thing about atheists is that they don't care about your beliefs as long as you don't try to convert them into yours. 
Martin:  I'm fine with that.  So how do you know I am not a converter?
Mike: Lucky guess? 
Martin:  Hah.
Mike:  But there is a difference between wanting people to join your side and being so narrow minded that you would shoot everyone else in the foot because you don't agree on something. Today with the internet people are discovering some other people are different. 
Martin:  I don't think people are going to give up their religions.  Even if your plan works, people will still have their religions.
Mike: Maybe the old generation but the new generation will. There is too much information available, too easy today. People will realize someone is just using them.  And the new generation will not grow up with these beliefs to indoctrinate them.  They don't have the strong tribalism that the old generation had.  Instead, they have the internet and reality TV to unite them.
Martin:  I think you give today's youth too much credit.
Mike: Wait two generations then... we are talking 2100 still. 
Martin:  That is still too short.  Even if what you say is true, it will take more than two generation before this new system of religions spreads as a majority.
Mike: You can see this happened with MMA. The old traditional martial arts are learning and adapting the new one, the new generation is already learning the combined mix of several of them. You don't need to give up your old religion you just need to learn several new ones, and then learn the best methods to combine them all into something coherent which fits your intuitions. 
Martin:  Even if this is true, I have enough doubt that it will happen in time for me to provide a strong foundation for my religion.  And my religion is strong enough that it can spread without me.  This is precisely why I am not on board with your plan.
Mike: And what is yours? 
Martin:  Well I have several detailed, but the general one is to make my religion the only one in charge.  This may sound harsh, but it is the only way.
Mike: Haha people were trying this for thousands of years, this is even more stupid than democracy.  
Martin:  It may be, but I am going to try it.  You don't think my kind haven't been trying to take over for a long time?  We don't want to be in the shadows anymore.  You think it was easy to give up slavery?  Or giving up serfdom?  Giving up anything where we are on top is not easy for us, but we see it as the only way to ensure our survival.
Mike: In religions there is no one real on top, lots of dead people who don't care about you, telling you how to live your life. It's already better to be a slave to a living person than a slave to a dead one. 
Martin:  Look Mike, I know you are smart and you know I am too.  We can see the faults in others but not ourselves.  I think that is what makes us smart, but also makes us fall for stupid stuff.  I can assure you I have every intention in taking over, and I will not stop until I do. '
Mike: Good luck with that.
